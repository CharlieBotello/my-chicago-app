  {category: "origins", content: "As the Obama Administration seeks to create and save jobs through the AARP, a New Deal  institution is still having its effect felt some 75 years after it was created. The Works Progress Administration was created in 1935 and employed millions until its cancellation in 1943. One of its agencies was the Federal Art Project which employed out of work artists to create public works of art, mainly in post offices and in other federal facilities. Some of the more famous artists in this project were Thomas Hart Benton, Jackson Pollack, and Grant Wood. However, there was another young artist who used the FAP as a stepping stone to a long career in art.\n\nTo begin, Charles Turzak was born in Streator, Illinois, to Czech immigrants. After winning a prize contest sponsored by the Purina Company, Turzak attended the Chicago Art Institute. He would graduate in 1924 and work various odd jobs in and around Chicago before traveling to Europe. There he studied the “masters” of Europe in galleries in and around Germany, Austria, and France. Upon his return, the crash of the Stock Market signaled troubled times ahead for Mr. Turzak.\n\nEarly on, Turzak tried his hand at watercolors before returning to illustrate books. He had first illustrated a book called, “Eastward Ho!” in the 1920s. By using mainly wood prints, Turzak’s black and white art stood out. His second book of illustrations was called, “All About Chicago”. He would add two more illustrated books in the 1930s, “Abraham Lincoln: A Biography in Woodcuts” and “Benjamin Franklin: A Biography in Woodcuts”. Turzak even tried his hand at watercolors again but it was his woodcuts that were gaining attention.\n\nTo his advantage, Turzak was contracted by the Federal Art Project to do a mural in the post office in Lemont, Illinois. One of the stipulations of the contract was that Turzak was to buy his own supplies using federal money and he got to keep the tools when the job was done. Once again, Turzak kept with a Lincoln theme painting the above mural entitled “Canal Boats”. The supplies would help his career immensely.\n\nSome additional art created for the WPA/FAP was about Illinois History. Striking in its lines and content, a series of woodcuts of what the French called The Illinois Country, are still in circulation today.\n  \nTurzak would go on to a successful career in teaching art, art direction, advertising and eventually a move to Florida produced a change to more color in his work.\n\n\nGeorge Rogers Clark Captures Kaskaskia\n\nWhen one looks back at the art of Charles Turzak, one is drawn to the clean lines, the black and white contrasts of the wood prints, and the simplicity of the story told. While his other contemporaries may have signaled a shift in the art of America, Turzak’s simple works are echoing today. Whereas Thomas Benton Hart, Pollack, and Wood created masterpieces of American Art, Turzak’s art is still quality work. Turzak’s friendship with Frank Lloyd Wright is a sign of the appreciation of his art. Turzak’s daughter states:\n\nOver the years, social engagements and art functions had brought the Turzaks and the Wrights, Frank Lloyd and Olgivanna, into an acquaintanceship. They had often visited each other both in Chicago and at Taliesen, the Wright’s hillside home, and studio/ school of architecture in southwestern Wisconsin, near Spring Green. After the war ended, the Wright’s held a grand weekend get-together for their mid-western friends with Charles and Florence being among the invited guests. This visit with Frank and Olgivanna would prove to be their last, as Taliesen West, near Scottsdale, Arizona, was to become the Wright’s permanent home…\n\nEven Turzak’s house, built by Bruce Goff is a Chicago Landmark. It:\n\nstands in pronounced contrast to traditional residences of the period. Designed as the home and studio for artist Charles Turzak and his family, it incorporated many features that did not typically appear in residential architecture until more than a decade later, including a carport, corner picture windows, and overhanging balconies.\n\n\n\nIn the end, Turzak may be a minor artist of the Depression Era but his work has withstood the test of time. He may not be Thomas Hart Benton but his work is still sold at many galleries and websites today. Part of the reason is the testament to the art. Another reason is the art is reflection of the time. And his career is a reflection of Chicago and Illinois in the Great Depression. One simple job created ended up fulfilling one man’s life and career.", title: "CHARLES TURZAK – COMING TO THE FRONT"},

  {category: "origins", content: "333 North Michigan is a skyscraper in the art deco style located in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois in the United States. Architecturally, it is noted for its dramatic upper-level setbacks that were inspired by the 1923 skyscraper zoning laws. Geographically, it is known as one of the four 1920s flanks of the Michigan Avenue Bridge (along with the Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower and the London Guarantee Building) that are contributing properties to the Michigan–Wacker Historic District, which is a U.S. Registered Historic District.\n\nAdditionally, it is known as the geographic beneficiary of the jog in Michigan Avenue, which makes it visible along the Magnificent Mile as the building that seems to be in the middle of the road at the foot of this stretch of road (pictured at left).[2][4] The building was designed by Holabird & Roche/Holabird & Root and completed in 1928. It is 396 feet (120.7 m) tall, and has 34 storeys.\n\nIt was designated a Chicago Landmark on February 7, 1997. It is located on the short quarter mile stretch of Michigan Avenue between the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the Magnificent Mile.\n\nDesigned by John Wellborn Root, Jr., the building's long and narrow footprint and towering structure are a tribute to Root's father John Wellborn Root's earlier Chicago Monadnock Building; Louis Sullivan's tall-building canon; and Eliel Saarinen's second-prize entry in the Tribune Tower design contest. The building was such a success that Holabird and Root took commercial residence there. The building's long and slender design optimized use of natural lighting. The building's interior represents Prohibition era modernism, especially its Art Deco Tavern club.\n\nThe building is embellished by a polished marble base, ornamental bands, and reliefs depicting frontiersmen and Native Americans at Fort Dearborn, which partially occupied the site.\n    ", title: "origins"},
  {category: "origins", content: "The light was constructed in 1893 for the World's Columbian Exposition and moved to its present site in 1919.[9] The United States Lighthouse Board prominently displayed its state of the art wares and engineering achievements. Prominently featured was the engineering marvel of Spectacle Reef Light and a 111-foot-tall (34 m) skeletal cast iron lighthouse tower.\n\nAlso displayed at the Exposition were a number of Fresnel lenses, including a stunning Third Order Fresnel lens which was awarded first prize at a Paris glass exhibition. The lens featured alternating red and white panels, and had been ordered for installation in the New Point Loma Lighthouse in California.[11] The coincidental conclusion of construction of the new Chicago Harbor light and the close of the Exhibition prompted the Lighthouse Board to keep the lens in Chicago, and thus the lens was installed in the lantern room of the new tower.[10] The original lens has since been removed, and is now on display at Cabrillo National Monument in California.\n\nSurrounded by rip rap, the structure has several levels: a concrete base and two red roofed buildings with a tapered white cylinder between them which is topped by a parapet and the light itself.\n\nIn 1917 the breakwater was renovated. At that time, the lighthouse was moved to its present site, and its attached fog signal room and boathouse were built.\n\nThe design is 'unique . . . similar to that of the offshore sparkplug towers, but this tower is taller.' Except for the additions made at the time of the move, it 'bears some resemblance' to the Rock of Ages Light near Isle Royale on Lake Superior, which is its contemporary.\n\nThe lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 19, 1984, and later was designated a Chicago Landmark on April 9, 2003.\n\nIn 2005, the light was declared excess by the Coast Guard. It was offered at no cost to eligible entities, including federal, state, and local agencies, non-profit corporations, and educational organizations under the provisions of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000. After an unusually long delay,[13] United States Secretary of the Interior Kenneth Salazar initiated transfer to the City of Chicago on February 24, 2009. The city had designated the lighthouse a Chicago Landmark on April 9, 2003.\n\nThe Lighthouse's significant role in the development of Chicago is commemorated in a relief sculpture, entitled The Spirit of the Waters located near the LaSalle Street entrance of Chicago City Hall.", title: "origins"},
  {category: "origins", content: "The Lorraine Hansberry House in northwest Woodlawn is unremarkable in appearance. Its brown brick walls and minimal adornments mimic thousands of other brick three-flats built in Chicago throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Its outward appearance is transformed, however, when one learns that many of Hansberry’s experiences growing up in this house served as the inspiration behind her canonical play A Raisin in the Sun—a fictionalized reflection of her parent’s fight against housing discrimination in this very home.\n\nIn 1937, when Carl Hansberry (father of Lorraine) made the decision to purchase the home at 6140 South Rhodes Avenue, legally enforced segregation was in full swing. The majority of black residents and families were forced to live in the overpriced and under-maintained area known as the “Black Belt,” largely located on the South Side. In an effort to relocate his family out of these poor conditions, Hansberry made the knowingly dangerous move to Woodlawn—then a primarily white neighborhood. He purchased the home despite the existence of a restrictive covenant blocking any real estate from being “sold, leased to, or permitted to be occupied by any person of the colored race.”\n\nWhen white residents learned of the purchase, they took the Hansberry family to court, accusing them of being in violation of the covenant and demanding their immediate exit from the neighborhood. The Hansberrys refused to leave, citing they were not involved in the creation of the covenant, and therefore were not liable to abide by it. Their refusal to exit began a drawn out legal battle eventually manifesting in the United States Supreme Court Case, Hansberry v Lee. During this unending three-year period, the Hansberrys were subject to several attacks on their home and property, including several bricks thrown through their windows. It is said Mrs. Hansberry would patrol the house at night, armed with a loaded German Luger, to protect her family from unwanted guests.\n\nAfter nearly three years of fighting, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Hansberrys and overturned Woodlawn’s restrictive covenant. However, the decision did not address the overall unconstitutionality of racially restrictive covenants, but only the fact that Woodlawn’s covenant did not have the required ninety-five percent of homeowners’ signatures required to approve a covenant. Nonetheless, the victory marked a turning point in the fight against housing discrimination, and demonstrated to many that through courage and perseverance, enforced segregation could and would come to an end in the United States.", title: "Home Histories: Lorraine Hansberry Home"},
  {category: "origins", content: "This corner lot was used by the community for Independence Day picnics from 1875. However, in 1888 it was purchased by Dr. Wallace Abbott, a local doctor and pharmacist. He commissioned Rudolph Dahlgren and Oscar Livendahl to design the current home. It was completed in 1891.\n\nDr. Abbott had gotten his start in his pharmacy and medical office, located on Ravenswood Avenue, manufacturing the first medications in his kitchen apartment. The company he founded, Abbott Labs, moved with the family to this location in 1891, then the company moved to the first of several properties on Ravenswood.\nThe company sites were known for several spectacular fires as well as industrial accidents leading it to move in 1925 to rural North Chicago.\nDr. Abbott could boast of owning an early telephone, among the first on the North Side. It’s simple number was Lake View 143.\nThe 1900 Census notes Dr. Abbott, his wife Clara, their daughter, Dr. Abbott’s father, a cook a nurse girl and a stableman.\nThe Abbott Mansion during the years it struggled. \n\nDr. Abbott died on his way home from the office one day in July 1921.\nThe Abbotts moved in 1925, selling the building to the Maginot family.

Three separate companies operated thousands of cable cars over 82 miles of track. The three story powerhouse was built by the North Chicago Street Railroad Company in 1886-1887 for $35,000. “It was a striking presence in the River North area, which was a jumble of low-scale factories, warehouses and shipyards,” said a Commission on Chicago Landmarks Designation Report from 2000. The railroad company was organized by Charles Tyson Yerkes, the leading transit entrepreneur in Chicago during the late 19th century. At the height of his influence, Yerkes controlled eight separate street railway companies and 250 miles of track in the city.\n\nChicago historian Greg Borzo calls the LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse, the crown jewel of Chicago’s cable car remnants. He also notes, This powerhouse drove two cables: one that pulled cable cars through a tunnel under the Chicago River along LaSalle Street and around the downtown and another shorter cable that pulled cars along Illinois Street between Clark Street and Wells Street. Those cables, in turn, pulled the thousands of cable cars that, at the peak of their operation, brought approximately 100,000 workers into downtown Chicago each day.\n\nThe LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse helped make possible the rapid development of the citys outlying North Side neighborhoods during one of the greatest boom periods in the history of Chicago.\n\nCable cars operated in Chicago until 1906.\n\nThe LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 27, 2001.

  {category: "chicago", content: "It might seem absolutely inconceivable that there was a time in Chicago in which a fascist rally would attract thousands of people. But on June 18, 1939, the American flag and Nazi swastika banner flew side by side in what is now known as Merrimac Park. Chicago newspapers estimated that between 4,000 and 8,000 assembled to support the German-American Bund, an organization whose stated mission was to 'defend the Constitution, Flag, and Institutions of these United States of America.' But as at other Bund gatherings, those that spoke showed nothing but contempt for American democracy. There was remarkably little ideological difference between the German-American Bund and the Nazi Party in Germany. Several hundred men and boys dressed in uniforms resembling those worn by Nazi storm troopers. Vendors sold beer, brats, and anti-Semitic literature. At least 100 police officers were kept on reserve in case of a riot, but the only disturbance of the day involved a handful of brownshirts who had confiscated the film of a newspaper photographer. \n                The crowd would be safe from hearing from the groups it wished to eliminate from American society. Praising Adolf Hitler, Bund leader Fritz Kuhn appealed to the enthusiastic crowd to carry on his organization's 'patriotic fight' to 'free America.' The event, which began with 'The Star-Spangled Banner,'' ended with a Hitler salute and German hymns. The story of Nazism in Chicago began nearly 15 years earlier with the foundation of the Chicago chapter of the Teutonia Society, a group made up of working-class German immigrants who supported the National Socialist Party in Germany. Its national leader, a Chicago printer named Fritz Gissebl, would eventually end up as a high-ranking SS officer in Nazi-occupied Poland, although the group functioned more as a Hitler fan club and anti-Semitic drinking society than a fearsome political organization. When it disbanded in 1932, it had only about 500 members nationwide. \n\n                The Nazi party's seizure of power breathed new life into the movement. In July 1933, the Friends of New Germany held its first convention in Chicago, with the grandiose goal of unifying the millions of German-Americans under its banner. The group was no less hostile to Jews or leftists than were its counterparts in Germany. The historian Sander A. Diamond has suggested that skilled workers left economically insecure by the Depression formed the core of its membership. By April 1934, the Chicago chapter reportedly had 500 members, including 40 storm troopers that performed military drills each Thursday.\n\n                Although new members took an oath that affirmed the Führerprinzip—the principle that the leader's word was above any written law—the Friends of New Germany was such a fractious mess that the German government, which had long collaborated with the group, ordered German nationals to resign their memberships in October 1935. In March 1936, the German-American Bund was formed. Kuhn, a Detroit chemist and naturalized American citizen who had proven himself a skilled organizer, was elevated as its leader. The new American führer was able to bring stability to the project of spreading Nazism in the United States, projecting the illusion that it was a rapidly expanding mass movement. 'His bombast, propensity for exaggeration, and lies were part of his technique,' Diamond writes.\n\n                The Bund did not go unchallenged in Chicago. In September 1937, the Chicago Daily Times ran a ten-part series on the group. Two German-American brothers, James and John Metcalfe, went undercover and quickly rose in its ranks. Backed by the Bund's own malignant propaganda, they characterized the organization as an 'alien army' that considered not only Jews and Communists as its enemies, but also the Catholic Church and New Deal liberals. One Bundist told John Metcalfe that he had witnessed 'men dumped out of windows and killed' in Germany. 'The day will come over here when Jews get the same treatment on the street they get in Germany,' he said. The exposé intensified pressure for the federal government to investigate the group, particularly its ties to the German government.\n\n                While the group continued to portray itself as a deeply patriotic organization, its actions showed an alarming contempt for democratic traditions. At a meeting at the Germania Club in Lincoln Park that drew 1,000 participants in February 1938, William Kunze, the head of the Bund's publicity office, declared that Jews, representing 4 percent of the population, controlled the press, radio, movie studios, schools, courts, and finance. Asked how the Bund proposed 'to eliminate the Jews,' Kunze urged that legislation could be passed along the lines of those that excluded Asian immigration to the United States, adding that this might not be necessary 'if the Jew learns his lesson.' During the meeting, a storm trooper from Glenview smashed a reporter's camera. Two students were assaulted when they refused to salute the Nazi flag.\n\n                In October 1938, German-Americans and Czech-Americans protested a Bund celebration of the Nazi annexation of the Sudetenland. Demonstrators attempting to bring an American flag into the hall were beaten by Bundists. As the streets around the hall filled with 5,000-plus demonstrators, more than 150 police officers were called in to prevent a possible riot. 'We are not worried about those who want to break up our little volksfest,' Kuhn told his comrades.", title: "In 1939 Nazis rallied in Chicago to make Germany great again"},

In 1912, a one-legged murderous clown was on the loose. \n\nThat fall, wealthy heiress Sophie Singer and her fiancé moved to Chicago from Baltimore, into a house with another couple, a circus-performing duo that went by the name the Conways. Charles Conway—whose real name was Charles Cramer—was a clown who had at some point lost one of his legs in a circus accident, and walked on a wooden leg he fashioned himself. \n\nThe Conways were con artists, who made their living off whatever they could mooch off others. When the heiress decided Chicago life might not be for her, the housemates’ relationship turned sour. One day, Singer’s fiance, Will, came home from a day of gambling to find the door to the rooming house barricaded and its lock stuffed. When he broke down the door, he found Sophie, who had been strangled to death with the clown’s handkerchief. Her jewelry was gone. \n\nThe Conways (or rather, the Cramers) were soon caught in Charles’ hometown in Ohio. The story made national news.

Lombardo, with the help of Capone, later became President of the Unione Siciliana in November 1925, attempting to regain control of the unstable organization as well as instituting reforms, including opening membership to non-Sicilian Italian immigrants (such as the Neapolitan Capone) and changing the organization's name to the Italo-American National Union.\n\nLombardo's reforms, however, caused some resentment within Unione Siciliana members.

  {category: "chicago", content: "On this date Chicago began its 94-year reign as the nation's Second City. The 1,099,850 souls the United States Census counted in Chicago represented a 119 percent increase over the city's population just 10 years earlier. The landmark tally made Chicago second only to New York in size, a status the city held until it was eclipsed by Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nNot only did the size of Chicago change in that decade but so did its face and its flavor. 'Everyone had just come from somewhere--usually from the across the ocean--and all the world was going somewhere else,' wrote Edith Abbott in 'The Tenements of Chicago.' 'Here were the most foreign newspapers, the foreign banks, the steamship companies--Italian in one section, Greek in another . . . that made these areas not unlike a series of foreign cities brought together.'A chunk of the city's growth came from annexation. Six months before the census, voters in a 120-square-mile area outside the city announced they wanted in. But the most significant increase came from immigrants, who made up about 40 percent of the city's population in 1890. Immigration from northern and western Europe had been an important source of the city's population growth for decades, but by the 1890s, many newcomers originated from the countries of central, eastern and southern Europe.\nDrawn to Chicago because of its reputation abroad as a place with well-paying industrial jobs or because relatives already lived in the city, they often arrived with notes in English pinned to their clothes asking that they be directed to their brother's or their uncle's address. Others headed from the train station with their small bundles to one of the ethnic churches that became beachheads for all manner of newcomer.\n\nBy 1897 the Greek community--the largest in the nation, both then and a hundred years later--had its first permanent Greek Orthodox parish, Holy Trinity Church, on what became known as the Greek Delta at Halsted and Harrison Streets. The Greeks had either the good fortune or the good sense to center their community in the front yard of Jane Addams' Hull House, the first settlement house in the nation. Other settlement houses soon sprang up to help immigrants adjust to their new lives, including Erie Neighborhood House, which began as a Presbyterian church in 1870 and served impoverished Germans and Scandinavians in Chicago's West Town neighborhood.\n\nErie was among the settlement houses that survived, and its new clientele, mostly Hispanic immigrants, tells the continuing story of newcomers to Chicago.\n\nAt the turn of the century, nine out of 10 immigrants were from Europe. In the 1990s, immigrants to Chicago came from three distinct regions--Latin America, Europe and Asia. The top countries of origin were Mexico, Poland and the Philippines. In 1990 the government counted 878,000 immigrants in metropolitan Chicago, only slightly fewer than the 900,000 who lived in the area in 1910. And Edith Abbott, who found the ethnic media flourishing at the turn of the century, could just as easily have been writing about 1996, when there were more than one hundred ethnic newspapers and radio and television stations, from African to Ukrainian, whose Chicago area audience numbered 1 million.", title: "The 1890 Census and 'Second City'"},
  {category: "chicago", content: "The 1909 Plan of Chicago, also commonly referred to as the “Burnham Plan,” was a visionary Progressive Era proposal that sought to beautify Chicago and improve efficiency of commerce. Published through the support of the Commercial Club of Chicago, the plan used renderings to convey the possible scenarios for a rapidly growing city. Although many of its aspirational ideas never became reality, as a document, the Plan of Chicago continues to serve as a reference in urban design today.\n\nBeginning in 1906, a group of businessmen recognized the need to prepare a plan for Chicago’s growth and entrusted architect Daniel Burnham to develop a plan to address Chicago’s needs. Already famous for his role as Director of Works for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Daniel Burnham famously affirmed that Chicago should “make no little plans” for its future. He hired co-author Edward H. Bennett, then the two began their work.\n\nOver the course of nearly three years, Burnham and Bennett researched numerous cities around the world. They studied how the growth of these cities and how large-scale infrastructure influenced the economy and mobility of their inhabitants. As a result, the Plan of Chicago was broken down into six categories and focused on the economic, transportation and social needs of Chicagoans.\n\nThe six categories, as laid out by Burnham and Bennett in the final chapter of the Plan of Chicago, are as follows:\n\nThe improvement of the lake front.\nThe creation of a system of highways outside the city.\nThe improvement of railway terminals, and the development of a complete traction system for both freight and passengers.\nThe acquisition of an outer park system, and of parkway circuits.\nThe systematic arrangement of the streets and avenues within the city, in order to facilitate the movement to and from the business district.\nThe development of centers of intellectual life and of civic administration, so related as to give coherence and unity to the city.\nWhile these principle design elements provided a plan for Chicago, Burnham and Bennett’s plan did not immediately change the city. The plan was presented to the City Council of Chicago in July 1909. The council created a planning commission by November of that year with Mayor Fred A. Busse appointing Charles H. Wacker as permanent chair of the commission. Projects such as the widening of Chicago’s streets and boulevards took shape over the next few decades. New streets were introduced, such as Wacker Drive along the Chicago River. One of the most noticeable portions of the plan to come to fruition is the city’s 25 miles of lakefront (out of its 29 miles of lakeshore) that serve as public parkland.\n\nAlthough many of Burnham’s other initiatives were not directly implemented, the Plan of Chicago did have a profound impact on city planning. Burnham and Bennett wrote in its closing, “If, therefore, the plan is a good one, its adoption and realization will produce for us conditions in which business enterprises can be carried on with the utmost economy.” While the Plan of Chicago will never be fully realized, it continues to provide solutions and possibilities for the ever-changing Chicago—and for other cities around the globe.", title: "Plan of Chicago"},

As the police advanced, an individual who was never identified threw a bomb at them. The police and possibly some members of the crowd opened fire and chaos ensued. Seven police officers and at least one civilian died as a result of the violence that day, and an untold number of other people were injured.\nThe Haymarket Riot set off a national wave of xenophobia, as scores of foreign-born radicals and labor organizers were rounded up by the police in Chicago and elsewhere. In August 1886, eight men, labeled as anarchists, were convicted in a sensational and controversial trial in which the jury was considered to be biased and no solid evidence was presented linking the defendants to the bombing.\n\nJudge Joseph E. Gary imposed the death sentence on seven of the men, and the eighth was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Telephone lines carried a play-by-play of the matchup—between Coach Amos Alonso Stagg’s formidable Chicago Maroons (frequent Big Ten champs in those days) and the well-regarded Princeton Tigers—from Chicago’s Stagg Field to radio receivers up and down the East Coast. After Princeton’s unlikely victory, her fans were just as unruly as they would have been if they’d seen the game for themselves: They thronged the town’s main street, lit bonfires and stole into Nassau Hall to ring the University’s bell, a celebration usually reserved for victories over Princeton’s Big Three rivals Harvard and Yale.\n\nAthletic contests were among the first live events that radio stations broadcast, and they were definitely the most popular. Station managers and advertisers could always guarantee an audience for horse races, baseball games and boxing matches. But early broadcasts of college football games were almost always local ones, and they weren’t quite live—typically, a reporter in the stadium pressbox would wire or telephone a detailed account of the events on the field to the station, where an announcer would re-enact the play-by-play, sometimes with sound effects, for the radio audience. The first live broadcast of a college football game didn’t happen until 1924, when announcers Edwin “Ty” Tyson and Leonard “Doc” Holland broadcast the Michigan-Wisconsin game right from the stands at Ferry Field.\n\nBut even in this secondhand form, the radio gods could hardly have picked a more exciting game for the first long-distance transmission of a college football matchup. Princeton took an early lead, but then Chicago fullback John Thomas scored three consecutive touchdowns. Chicago kept its 18-7 lead until the fourth quarter, when Princeton’s Howdy Gray picked up a fumble and sprinted 42 yards for a touchdown. Minutes later, Gray’s teammate Harry Crum scored his second touchdown of the day, and Princeton was winning again.

But a determined Princeton defense kept Thomas from scoring again, and the Tigers won the game.\n\n“The wonders of wireless technology were never better exemplified,” one Princeton alum wrote, and it was true—college swells and middle-aged sports fans listened breathlessly to the reenacted play-by-play, eager to find out how the game would end. The New York Times reported that the town of Princeton was filled with listeners, all “cheering madly one minute, groaning hoarsely the next.” The Tigers kept on winning—they went 8 and 0 in the 1922 season and beat Harvard and Yale to win the Big Three championship—but their victory over Chicago, broadcast over the airwaves for all to share, was perhaps the sweetest.\n\n  by Taboola Promoted Links \n", title: "Princeton-Chicago football game is broadcast across the country"},

But as at other Bund gatherings, those that spoke showed nothing but contempt for American democracy. There was remarkably little ideological difference between the German-American Bund and the Nazi Party in Germany.

Praising Adolf Hitler, Bund leader Fritz Kuhn appealed to the enthusiastic crowd to carry on his organization's 'patriotic fight' to 'free America.' The event, which began with 'The Star-Spangled Banner,'' ended with a Hitler salute and German hymns. The story of Nazism in Chicago began nearly 15 years earlier with the foundation of the Chicago chapter of the Teutonia Society, a group made up of working-class German immigrants who supported the National Socialist Party in Germany. Its national leader, a Chicago printer named Fritz Gissebl, would eventually end up as a high-ranking SS officer in Nazi-occupied Poland, although the group functioned more as a Hitler fan club and anti-Semitic drinking society than a fearsome political organization. When it disbanded in 1932, it had only about 500 members nationwide. \n\n                The Nazi party's seizure of power breathed new life into the movement. In July 1933, the Friends of New Germany held its first convention in Chicago, with the grandiose goal of unifying the millions of German-Americans under its banner. The group was no less hostile to Jews or leftists than were its counterparts in Germany. The historian Sander A. Diamond has suggested that skilled workers left economically insecure by the Depression formed the core of its membership. By April 1934, the Chicago chapter reportedly had 500 members, including 40 storm troopers that performed military drills each Thursday.\n\n                Although new members took an oath that affirmed the Führerprinzip—the principle that the leader's word was above any written law—the Friends of New Germany was such a fractious mess that the German government, which had long collaborated with the group, ordered German nationals to resign their memberships in October 1935. In March 1936, the German-American Bund was formed. Kuhn, a Detroit chemist and naturalized American citizen who had proven himself a skilled organizer, was elevated as its leader. The new American führer was able to bring stability to the project of spreading Nazism in the United States, projecting the illusion that it was a rapidly expanding mass movement. 'His bombast, propensity for exaggeration, and lies were part of his technique,' Diamond writes.\n\n                The Bund did not go unchallenged in Chicago. In September 1937, the Chicago Daily Times ran a ten-part series on the group. Two German-American brothers, James and John Metcalfe, went undercover and quickly rose in its ranks. Backed by the Bund's own malignant propaganda, they characterized the organization as an 'alien army' that considered not only Jews and Communists as its enemies, but also the Catholic Church and New Deal liberals. One Bundist told John Metcalfe that he had witnessed 'men dumped out of windows and killed' in Germany. 'The day will come over here when Jews get the same treatment on the street they get in Germany,' he said. The exposé intensified pressure for the federal government to investigate the group, particularly its ties to the German government.\n\n                While the group continued to portray itself as a deeply patriotic organization, its actions showed an alarming contempt for democratic traditions. At a meeting at the Germania Club in Lincoln Park that drew 1,000 participants in February 1938, William Kunze, the head of the Bund's publicity office, declared that Jews, representing 4 percent of the population, controlled the press, radio, movie studios, schools, courts, and finance. Asked how the Bund proposed 'to eliminate the Jews,' Kunze urged that legislation could be passed along the lines of those that excluded Asian immigration to the United States, adding that this might not be necessary 'if the Jew learns his lesson.' During the meeting, a storm trooper from Glenview smashed a reporter's camera. Two students were assaulted when they refused to salute the Nazi flag.\n\n                In October 1938, German-Americans and Czech-Americans protested a Bund celebration of the Nazi annexation of the Sudetenland. Demonstrators attempting to bring an American flag into the hall were beaten by Bundists. As the streets around the hall filled with 5,000-plus demonstrators, more than 150 police officers were called in to prevent a possible riot.

One day, Singer’s fiance, Will, came home from a day of gambling to find the door to the rooming house barricaded and its lock stuffed. When he broke down the door, he found Sophie, who had been strangled to death with the clown’s handkerchief. Her jewelry was gone. \n\nThe Conways (or rather, the Cramers) were soon caught in Charles’ hometown in Ohio. The story made national news. The trial, in 1913, was also covered in papers across the country. And it did include some tomfoolery, as Chicago-based author and tour guide Adam Selzer writes on his blog, Mysterious Chicago:\n\nIn the midst of confessing, he did a bit of clowning with reporters and police. ‘Say, Captain?’ he asked. ‘Do you know that in this case you can't hang a man with a wooden leg?’ When the Captain said he'd never heard of a law like that, Cramer said ‘You have to use a rope!’\n\nCharles and his wife were convicted, Charles for life. But he didn’t serve his full term. In 1925—despite his presumed lack of running agility—he managed to escape from the prison farm he was working on. He was last spotted in 1929.", title: "In 1912, Chicago Had a One-Legged Murderous Clown"},

A long time Mafia associate, Lombardo became Al Capone's advisor after John Torrio retired in 1925.\n\nLombardo tried unsuccessfully to negotiate peace between the Chicago Outfit and the North Side Gang during the four-year gang war, suggesting that Capone surrender supposed Dean O'Banion assassins Albert Anselmi and John Scalise, which Capone refused. Lombardo, with the help of Capone, later became President of the Unione Siciliana in November 1925, attempting to regain control of the unstable organization as well as instituting reforms, including opening membership to non-Sicilian Italian immigrants (such as the Neapolitan Capone) and changing the organization's name to the Italo-American National Union.\n\nLombardo's reforms, however, caused some resentment within Unione Siciliana members. With the partnership of Al Capone and New York gangster Frankie Yale worsening, possibly due to the end of payoffs from the Unione Siciliana to Yale, Lombardo was challenged for the Presidency by Joe Aiello, supported by Yale, in January 1928.\n\nLombardo, however, refused to resign and continued to organize civic projects under the Unione Siciliana until shortly before his death on September 7, 1928. Lombardo was gunned down, along with his bodyguard Joseph Ferrara (although bodyguard Joe Lolordo survived), allegedly by an alliance of the Joe Aiello Gang and the North Side Gang, at the intersections of Madison Street and Dearborn Street. It was said that Moran ordered this death and had his two experienced gunman do the job with the help of Aiello. Thought to be retaliation for the murder of Frankie Yale the previous July, Lombardo's death was in turn soon avenged with the murder of members of the Joe Aiello Gang and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, in 1929.

  {category: "chicago", content: "On this date Chicago began its 94-year reign as the nation's Second City. The 1,099,850 souls the United States Census counted in Chicago represented a 119 percent increase over the city's population just 10 years earlier. The landmark tally made Chicago second only to New York in size, a status the city held until it was eclipsed by Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nNot only did the size of Chicago change in that decade but so did its face and its flavor. 'Everyone had just come from somewhere--usually from the across the ocean--and all the world was going somewhere else,' wrote Edith Abbott in 'The Tenements of Chicago.' 'Here were the most foreign newspapers, the foreign banks, the steamship companies--Italian in one section, Greek in another . . . that made these areas not unlike a series of foreign cities brought together.'A chunk of the city's growth came from annexation. Six months before the census, voters in a 120-square-mile area outside the city announced they wanted in. But the most significant increase came from immigrants, who made up about 40 percent of the city's population in 1890. Immigration from northern and western Europe had been an important source of the city's population growth for decades, but by the 1890s, many newcomers originated from the countries of central, eastern and southern Europe.\nDrawn to Chicago because of its reputation abroad as a place with well-paying industrial jobs or because relatives already lived in the city, they often arrived with notes in English pinned to their clothes asking that they be directed to their brother's or their uncle's address. Others headed from the train station with their small bundles to one of the ethnic churches that became beachheads for all manner of newcomer.\n\nBy 1897 the Greek community--the largest in the nation, both then and a hundred years later--had its first permanent Greek Orthodox parish, Holy Trinity Church, on what became known as the Greek Delta at Halsted and Harrison Streets. The Greeks had either the good fortune or the good sense to center their community in the front yard of Jane Addams' Hull House, the first settlement house in the nation. Other settlement houses soon sprang up to help immigrants adjust to their new lives, including Erie Neighborhood House, which began as a Presbyterian church in 1870 and served impoverished Germans and Scandinavians in Chicago's West Town neighborhood.\n\nErie was among the settlement houses that survived, and its new clientele, mostly Hispanic immigrants, tells the continuing story of newcomers to Chicago.\n\nAt the turn of the century, nine out of 10 immigrants were from Europe. In the 1990s, immigrants to Chicago came from three distinct regions--Latin America, Europe and Asia. The top countries of origin were Mexico, Poland and the Philippines. In 1990 the government counted 878,000 immigrants in metropolitan Chicago, only slightly fewer than the 900,000 who lived in the area in 1910. And Edith Abbott, who found the ethnic media flourishing at the turn of the century, could just as easily have been writing about 1996, when there were more than one hundred ethnic newspapers and radio and television stations, from African to Ukrainian, whose Chicago area audience numbered 1 million.", title: "The 1890 Census and 'Second City'"},
  {category: "chicago", content: "The 1909 Plan of Chicago, also commonly referred to as the “Burnham Plan,” was a visionary Progressive Era proposal that sought to beautify Chicago and improve efficiency of commerce. Published through the support of the Commercial Club of Chicago, the plan used renderings to convey the possible scenarios for a rapidly growing city. Although many of its aspirational ideas never became reality, as a document, the Plan of Chicago continues to serve as a reference in urban design today.\n\nBeginning in 1906, a group of businessmen recognized the need to prepare a plan for Chicago’s growth and entrusted architect Daniel Burnham to develop a plan to address Chicago’s needs. Already famous for his role as Director of Works for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Daniel Burnham famously affirmed that Chicago should “make no little plans” for its future. He hired co-author Edward H. Bennett, then the two began their work.\n\nOver the course of nearly three years, Burnham and Bennett researched numerous cities around the world. They studied how the growth of these cities and how large-scale infrastructure influenced the economy and mobility of their inhabitants. As a result, the Plan of Chicago was broken down into six categories and focused on the economic, transportation and social needs of Chicagoans.\n\nThe six categories, as laid out by Burnham and Bennett in the final chapter of the Plan of Chicago, are as follows:\n\nThe improvement of the lake front.\nThe creation of a system of highways outside the city.\nThe improvement of railway terminals, and the development of a complete traction system for both freight and passengers.\nThe acquisition of an outer park system, and of parkway circuits.\nThe systematic arrangement of the streets and avenues within the city, in order to facilitate the movement to and from the business district.\nThe development of centers of intellectual life and of civic administration, so related as to give coherence and unity to the city.\nWhile these principle design elements provided a plan for Chicago, Burnham and Bennett’s plan did not immediately change the city. The plan was presented to the City Council of Chicago in July 1909. The council created a planning commission by November of that year with Mayor Fred A. Busse appointing Charles H. Wacker as permanent chair of the commission. Projects such as the widening of Chicago’s streets and boulevards took shape over the next few decades. New streets were introduced, such as Wacker Drive along the Chicago River. One of the most noticeable portions of the plan to come to fruition is the city’s 25 miles of lakefront (out of its 29 miles of lakeshore) that serve as public parkland.\n\nAlthough many of Burnham’s other initiatives were not directly implemented, the Plan of Chicago did have a profound impact on city planning. Burnham and Bennett wrote in its closing, “If, therefore, the plan is a good one, its adoption and realization will produce for us conditions in which business enterprises can be carried on with the utmost economy.” While the Plan of Chicago will never be fully realized, it continues to provide solutions and possibilities for the ever-changing Chicago—and for other cities around the globe.", title: "Plan of Chicago"},

In the 19th century, archeologists from all over the world flocked to Egypt, where they uncovered a number of these tombs. Many had long ago been broken into by robbers and stripped of their riches.\n\nWhen Carter arrived in Egypt in 1891, he became convinced there was at least one undiscovered tomb–that of the little known Tutankhamen, or King Tut, who lived around 1400 B.C. and died when he was still a teenager. Backed by a rich Brit, Lord Carnarvon, Carter searched for five years without success. In early 1922, Lord Carnarvon wanted to call off the search, but Carter convinced him to hold on one more year.\n\nIn November 1922, the wait paid off, when Carter’s team found steps hidden in the debris near the entrance of another tomb. The steps led to an ancient sealed doorway bearing the name Tutankhamen. When Carter and Lord Carnarvon entered the tomb’s interior chambers on November 26, they were thrilled to find it virtually intact, with its treasures untouched after more than 3,000 years. The men began exploring the four rooms of the tomb, and on February 16, 1923, under the watchful eyes of a number of important officials, Carter opened the door to the last chamber.\n\nInside lay a sarcophagus with three coffins nested inside one another. The last coffin, made of solid gold, contained the mummified body of King Tut. Among the riches found in the tomb–golden shrines, jewelry, statues, a chariot, weapons, clothing–the perfectly preserved mummy was the most valuable, as it was the first one ever to be discovered. Despite rumors that a curse would befall anyone who disturbed the tomb, its treasures were carefully catalogued, removed and included in a famous traveling exhibition called the “Treasures of Tutankhamen.” The exhibition’s permanent home is the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\n  by Taboola Promoted Links \n", title: "Archaeologist opens tomb of King Tut"},

As the police advanced, an individual who was never identified threw a bomb at them. The police and possibly some members of the crowd opened fire and chaos ensued. Seven police officers and at least one civilian died as a result of the violence that day, and an untold number of other people were injured.\nThe Haymarket Riot set off a national wave of xenophobia, as scores of foreign-born radicals and labor organizers were rounded up by the police in Chicago and elsewhere. In August 1886, eight men, labeled as anarchists, were convicted in a sensational and controversial trial in which the jury was considered to be biased and no solid evidence was presented linking the defendants to the bombing.\n\nJudge Joseph E.

Telephone lines carried a play-by-play of the matchup—between Coach Amos Alonso Stagg’s formidable Chicago Maroons (frequent Big Ten champs in those days) and the well-regarded Princeton Tigers—from Chicago’s Stagg Field to radio receivers up and down the East Coast. After Princeton’s unlikely victory, her fans were just as unruly as they would have been if they’d seen the game for themselves: They thronged the town’s main street, lit bonfires and stole into Nassau Hall to ring the University’s bell, a celebration usually reserved for victories over Princeton’s Big Three rivals Harvard and Yale.\n\nAthletic contests were among the first live events that radio stations broadcast, and they were definitely the most popular. Station managers and advertisers could always guarantee an audience for horse races, baseball games and boxing matches. But early broadcasts of college football games were almost always local ones, and they weren’t quite live—typically, a reporter in the stadium pressbox would wire or telephone a detailed account of the events on the field to the station, where an announcer would re-enact the play-by-play, sometimes with sound effects, for the radio audience. The first live broadcast of a college football game didn’t happen until 1924, when announcers Edwin “Ty” Tyson and Leonard “Doc” Holland broadcast the Michigan-Wisconsin game right from the stands at Ferry Field.\n\nBut even in this secondhand form, the radio gods could hardly have picked a more exciting game for the first long-distance transmission of a college football matchup. Princeton took an early lead, but then Chicago fullback John Thomas scored three consecutive touchdowns. Chicago kept its 18-7 lead until the fourth quarter, when Princeton’s Howdy Gray picked up a fumble and sprinted 42 yards for a touchdown. Minutes later, Gray’s teammate Harry Crum scored his second touchdown of the day, and Princeton was winning again. But Stagg’s team didn’t give up easily: The Maroons kept pushing until they were just one foot, and one down, away from scoring the game-winning touchdown. But a determined Princeton defense kept Thomas from scoring again, and the Tigers won the game.\n\n“The wonders of wireless technology were never better exemplified,” one Princeton alum wrote, and it was true—college swells and middle-aged sports fans listened breathlessly to the reenacted play-by-play, eager to find out how the game would end. The New York Times reported that the town of Princeton was filled with listeners, all “cheering madly one minute, groaning hoarsely the next.” The Tigers kept on winning—they went 8 and 0 in the 1922 season and beat Harvard and Yale to win the Big Three championship—but their victory over Chicago, broadcast over the airwaves for all to share, was perhaps the sweetest.\n\n  by Taboola Promoted Links \n", title: "Princeton-Chicago football game is broadcast across the country"},
  {category: "world", content: "At 4:45 a.m., some 1.5 million German troops invade Poland all along its 1,750-mile border with German-controlled territory. Simultaneously, the German Luftwaffe bombed Polish airfields, and German warships and U-boats attacked Polish naval forces in the Baltic Sea. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler claimed the massive invasion was a defensive action, but Britain and France were not convinced. On September 3, they declared war on Germany, initiating World War II.\n\nTo Hitler, the conquest of Poland would bring Lebensraum, or “living space,” for the German people. According to his plan, the “racially superior” Germans would colonize the territory and the native Slavs would be enslaved. German expansion had begun in 1938 with the annexation of Austria and then continued with the occupation of the Sudetenland and then all of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Both had been accomplished without igniting hostilities with the major powers, and Hitler hoped that his invasion of Poland would likewise be tolerated.\n\nTo neutralize the possibility that the USSR would come to Poland’s aid, Germany signed a nonaggression pact with the Soviet Union on August 23, 1939. In a secret clause of the agreement, the ideological enemies agreed to divide Poland between them. Hitler gave orders for the Poland invasion to begin on August 26, but on August 25 he delayed the attack when he learned that Britain had signed a new treaty with Poland, promising military support should it be attacked. To forestall a British intervention, Hitler turned to propaganda and misinformation, alleging persecution of German-speakers in eastern Poland. Fearing imminent attack, Poland began to call up its troops, but Britain and France persuaded Poland to postpone general mobilization until August 31 in a last ditch effort to dissuade Germany from war.\n\nShortly after noon on August 31, Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to begin at 4:45 a.m. the next morning. At 8 p.m. on August 31, Nazi S.S. troops wearing Polish uniforms staged a phony invasion of Germany, damaging several minor installations on the German side of the border. They also left behind a handful of dead concentration camp prisoners in Polish uniforms to serve as further evidence of the supposed Polish invasion, which Nazi propagandists publicized as an unforgivable act of aggression.\n\nAt 4:45 a.m. on September 1, the invasion began. Nazi diplomats and propagandists scrambled to head off hostilities with the Western powers, but on September 2 Britain and France demanded that Germany withdraw by September 3 or face war. At 11 p.m. on September 3, the British ultimatum expired, and 15 minutes later British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain went on national radio to solemnly announce that Britain was at war with Germany. Australia, New Zealand, and India followed suit shortly thereafter. At 5:00 p.m., France declared war on Germany.\n\nIn Poland, German forces advanced at a dizzying rate. Employing a military strategy known as the blitzkrieg, or “lightning war,” armored divisions smashed through enemy lines and isolated segments of the enemy, which were encircled and captured by motorized German infantry while the panzer tanks rushed forward to repeat the pattern. Meanwhile, the sophisticated German air force–the Luftwaffe–destroyed Polish air capability, provided air support for the blitzkrieg, and indiscriminately bombed Polish cities in an effort to further terrorize the enemy.\n\nThe Polish army was able to mobilize one million men but was hopelessly outmatched in every respect. Rather than take a strong defensive position, troops were rushed to the front to confront the Germans and were systematically captured or annihilated. In a famously ill-fated strategy, Polish commanders even sent horsed cavalry into battle against the heavy German armor. By September 8, German forces had reached the outskirts of Warsaw, having advanced 140 miles in the first week of the invasion.\n\nThe Polish armed forces hoped to hold out long enough so that an offensive could be mounted against Germany in the west, but on September 17 Soviet forces invaded from the east and all hope was lost. The next day, Poland’s government and military leaders fled the country. On September 28, the Warsaw garrison finally surrendered to a relentless German siege. That day, Germany and the USSR concluded an agreement outlining their zones of occupation. For the fourth time in its history, Poland was partitioned by its more powerful neighbors.\n\nDespite their declaration of war against Germany, Britain and France did little militarily to aid Poland. Britain bombed German warships on September 4, but Chamberlain resisted bombing Germany itself. Though Germans kept only 23 divisions in the west during their campaign in Poland, France did not launch a full-scale attack even though it had mobilized over four times that number. There were modest assaults by France on its border with Germany but these actions ceased with the defeat of Poland. During the subsequent seven months, some observers accused Britain and France of waging a “phony war,” because, with the exception of a few dramatic British-German clashes at sea, no major military action was taken. However, hostilities escalated exponentially in 1940 with Germany’s April invasion of Norway and May invasion of the Low Countries and France.\n\nIn June 1941, Hitler attacked the USSR, breaking his nonaggression with the Soviet Union, and Germany seized all of Poland. During the German occupation, nearly three million Polish Jews were killed in the Nazi death camps. The Nazis also severely persecuted the Slavic majority, deporting and executing Poles in an attempt to destroy the intelligentsia and Polish culture. A large Polish resistance movement effectively fought against the occupation with the assistance of the Polish government-in-exile. Many exiled Poles also fought for the Allied cause. The Soviets completed the liberation of Poland in 1945 and established a communist government in the nation.”", title: "Germans invade Poland"},

The massive ship, which carried 2,200 passengers and crew, had struck an iceberg two and half hours before.\n\nOn April 10, the RMS Titanic, one of the largest and most luxurious ocean liners ever built, departed Southampton, England, on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. The Titanic was designed by the Irish shipbuilder William Pirrie and built in Belfast, and was thought to be the world’s fastest ship. It spanned 883 feet from stern to bow, and its hull was divided into 16 compartments that were presumed to be watertight. Because four of these compartments could be flooded without causing a critical loss of buoyancy, the Titanic was considered unsinkable. While leaving port, the ship came within a couple of feet of the steamer New York but passed safely by, causing a general sigh of relief from the passengers massed on the Titanic‘s decks. On its first journey across the highly competitive Atlantic ferry route, the ship carried some 2,200 passengers and crew.\n\nAfter stopping at Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown, Ireland, to pick up some final passengers, the massive vessel set out at full speed for New York City. However, just before midnight on April 14, the RMS Titanic failed to divert its course from an iceberg and ruptured at least five of its hull compartments. These compartments filled with water and pulled down the bow of the ship. Because the Titanic‘s compartments were not capped at the top, water from the ruptured compartments filled each succeeding compartment, causing the bow to sink and the stern to be raised up to an almost vertical position above the water. Then the Titanic broke in half, and, at about 2:20 a.m. on April 15, stern and bow sank to the ocean floor.\n\nBecause of a shortage of lifeboats and the lack of satisfactory emergency procedures, more than 1,500 people went down in the sinking ship or froze to death in the icy North Atlantic waters. Most of the 700 or so survivors were women and children. A number of notable American and British citizens died in the tragedy, including the noted British journalist William Thomas Stead and heirs to the Straus, Astor, and Guggenheim fortunes.\n\nOne hour and 20 minutes after Titanic went down, the Cunard liner Carpathia arrived. The survivors in the lifeboats were brought aboard, and a handful of others were pulled out of the water. It was later discovered that the Leyland liner Californian had been less than 20 miles away at the time of the accident but had failed to hear the Titanic‘s distress signals because its radio operator was off duty.\n\nAnnouncement of details of the tragedy led to outrage on both sides of the Atlantic. In the disaster’s aftermath, the first International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea was held in 1913. Rules were adopted requiring that every ship have lifeboat space for each person on board, and that lifeboat drills be held. An International Ice Patrol was established to monitor icebergs in the North Atlantic shipping lanes. It was also required that ships maintain a 24-hour radio watch.\n\nOn September 1, 1985, a joint U.S.-French expedition located the wreck of the Titanic lying on the ocean floor at a depth of about 13,000 feet. The ship was explored by manned and unmanned submersibles, which shed new light on the details of its sinking.", title: "Titanic sinks"},

In 1898, he was arrested for his revolutionary activities and sent to prison. In 1900, he was exiled to Siberia.\n\nIn 1902, he escaped to England using a forged passport under the name of Leon Trotsky (his original name was Lev Davidovich Bronshtein). In London, he collaborated with Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Ilyich Lenin but later sided with the Menshevik factions that advocated a democratic approach to socialism. With the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1905, Trotsky returned to Russia and was again exiled to Siberia when the revolution collapsed. In 1907, he again escaped.\n\nDuring the next decade, he was expelled from a series of countries because of his radicalism, living in Switzerland, Paris, Spain, and New York City before returning to Russia at the outbreak of the revolution in 1917.

Against Stalin’s stated policies, Trotsky called for a continuing world revolution that would inevitably result in the dismantling of the Soviet state. He also criticized the new regime for suppressing democracy in the Communist Party and for failing to develop adequate economic planning. In response, Stalin and his supporters launched a propaganda counterattack against Trotsky. In 1925, he was removed from his post in the war commissariat. One year later, he was expelled from the Politburo and in 1927 from the Communist Party.

With a single shot from a pistol the mad dash began, and land-hungry pioneers on horseback and in carriages raced forward to stake their claims to the best acres.\n\nIronically, not many years before that same land had once been considered worthless desert. Early explorers of Oklahoma believed that the territory was too arid and treeless for white settlement, but several suggested it might be the perfect place to resettle Indians, whose rich and fertile lands in the southeast were increasingly coveted by Americans. The U.S. government later took this advice and began removing eastern Indian tribes like the Cherokee and Choctaw to Oklahoma Territory in 1817. No more eager than the whites to leave their green and well-watered lands for the arid plains, some Indians resisted and had to be removed by force-most tragically, the 4,000 Cherokee who died during the brutal overland march known appropriately as the “Trail of Tears.”\n\nBy 1885, a diverse mixture of Native American tribes had been pushed onto reservations in eastern Oklahoma and promised that the land would be theirs “as long as the grass grows and the water runs.” Yet even this seemingly marginal land did not long escape the attention of land-hungry Americans. By the late nineteenth century, farmers had developed new methods that suddenly made the formerly reviled Plains hugely valuable. Pressure steadily increased to open the Indian lands to settlement, and in 1889, President Benjamin Harrison succumbed and threw open large areas of unoccupied Indian lands to white settlement.

Decades after Peary’s death, however, navigational errors in his travel log surfaced, placing the expedition in all probability a few miles short of its goal.\n\nPeary, a U.S. Navy civil engineer, made his first trip to the interior of Greenland in 1886. In 1891, Henson, a young African-American sailor, joined him on his second arctic expedition. Their team made an extended dogsled journey to the northeast of Greenland and explored what became known as “Peary Land.” In 1893, the explorers began working toward the North Pole, and in 1906, during their second attempt, they nearly reached latitude 88 degrees north–only 150 miles from their objective.\n\nIn 1908, the pair traveled to Ellesmere Island by ship and in 1909 raced across hundreds of miles of ice to reach what they calculated as latitude 90 degrees north on April 6, 1909.

A former associate of Peary, Cook claimed he had already reached the pole by dogsled the previous year. A major controversy followed, and in 1911 the U.S. Congress formally recognized Peary’s claim.\n\nIn recent years, further studies of the conflicting claims suggest that neither expedition reached the exact North Pole, but that Peary and Henson came far closer, falling perhaps 30 miles short.

He signed the act in a sincere but misguided attempt to improve the Native Americans’ lives by incorporating them into white culture, rejecting earlier policies toward Native Americans that forced them to live on desolate reservations where it was difficult to make a living. However, his support of the Dawes Severalty Act actually did more damage than good.\n\nUnder the Dawes Act, the head of each Native American family received 160 acres in an effort to encourage Native Americans to take up farming, live in smaller family units that were considered more American and renounce tribal loyalties. The government held such lands in trust for 25 years, until the recipients could prove themselves self-sufficient farmers. Before the family could sell their allotment, they were required to get a certificate of competency. If the family did not succeed at farming, the land reverted back to the federal government for sale, usually to white settlers. The Dawes Act reduced Native American landholdings from 138 million acres in 1887 to 78 million in 1900 and continued the trend of white settlement on previously Native American-held land. In addition, the law created federally funded boarding schools designed to assimilate Native American children into white society. Family and cultural ties were practically destroyed by the now-notorious boarding schools, in which children were punished for speaking their native language or performing native rituals.\n\nThe Dawes Severalty Act was finally abolished in 1934, during President Franklin Roosevelt’s first term.", title: "Cleveland signs devastating Dawes Act into law"},

Division Street is one of the best-remaining\nexamples of the architecturally distinctive Chicago taverns built by breweries around the turn of\nthe twentieth century.\nIn the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, a combination of intense competition among\nbrewing companies and increasing legal restrictions and social pressures on public drinking\nestablishments compelled brewing companies in Chicago to adopt a “tied house” system.\nDeveloped in England a century earlier, the tied-house system involved the direct control of\ntaverns not by independent entrepreneurs, but by large brewing companies which sold their\nproducts exclusively at their own establishments.\nBrewery control of the tavern trade in Chicago began with the purchase of existing saloon\nbuildings, but soon evolved into the acquisition of choice real estate and the design and\nconstruction of tavern buildings. At least forty-one of these tied-house buildings are known to\nsurvive in the city. They were built by large Milwaukee-based brewers, most notably Schlitz,\nand by several local brewers such as the Atlas, Birk Brothers, Fortune Brothers, Gottfried,\nPeter Hand, Standard, and Stege companies. In many cases, to attract customers, brewing\ncompanies employed high-quality architectural designs and popular historical styles of\narchitecture for their tied houses to attract, and perhaps also to convey the legitimacy and\ndecency of the neighborhood tavern in the face of rising social opposition.\nIn addition to the tied house’s contribution to Chicago’s historic neighborhood architecture,\nthese buildings convey important aspects of Chicago and American history in the late-nineteenth\nand early-twentieth centuries, including the large influx of European immigrants, the growth of\nthe vertically-integrated business model which sought to control all aspects of production from\nraw material to retail sale, and the increasing political power of anti-alcohol activists. The\nproliferation of tied houses in cities like Chicago was one of many factors that ultimately led to\nnational Prohibition in 1919.", title: "Tied House"},

Located in the heart of the Chicago Loop, the Daley Center was Chicago’s first major public building to be constructed in a modern rather than a classical architectural style.  The building’s architecture is International Style and was designed by architect Jacques Brownson of C.F. Murphy Associates.  This architectural style is based on the revolutionary steel and glass skyscrapers of world-famous architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.\n\nThe Daley Center has 31 floors and is the tallest flat-roofed building in the world with fewer then 40 stories (a typical 648-foot building would have 50-60 stories), owing to the high ceilings needed for courtrooms.  The building has no major interior columns, only twelve exterior columns shaped in plan like a cross. These columns get narrower toward the top as they support less weight.  It has 87-foot steel trusses running lengthwise and 48-foot spans running crosswise, at the time unprecedented in their dimensions.  The structural bays, (87-feet) are so wide that they are often compared to bridges.  The building was the first ever to be clad with untreated Corrosive Tensile (Cor-Ten) steel. Designed to rust overtime, the steel actually strengthens the structure and develops a natural rust patina giving the Daley Center its distinctive red and brown color.\n\nThe Daley Center was built to house more than 120 court and hearing rooms, the Cook County Law Library and office space for the City and Cook County.  It was built by the Chicago Public Building Commission and financed by revenue bonds.  The $87 million project was started February 28, 1963 and the first occupants moved into the Daley Center in May 1965.  The Chicago Civic Center was renamed the Richard J. Daley Center, Richard J.

He was dedicated to improving the city of Chicago and after the Haymarket Square riot in 1886 he began plans for the Auditorium Building, that included the theatre, as well as an office block and hotel. He envisioned a theatre for all Chicagoans, and incorporates the Chicago Auditorium Association for the purpose of developing the world’s largest, grandest, most expensive building.\n\nThe famous architectural firm of Adler and Sullivan designed this 4,000 seat theatre in 1889 using modern technology, including electric lighting and air conditioning.

For decades the Auditorium Theatre continued its decline before experiencing an astounding resurgence in the 1960’s, and ultimately returning to its former status as a jewel in American history.\n\nThanks to multiple restoration and conservation projects, visitors again enjoy the radiant 24-karat gold-leafed ceiling arches, hundreds of Sullivan’s beautifully restored intricate stencil patterns, ornate gilded and bas-relief designs, and the endless floor and wall mosaics and murals by Charles Holloway and Albert Fleury.\n\n", title: "Auditorium"},
  {category: "origins", content: "Born in Cedarville, Illinois, on September 6, 1860, and graduated from Rockford Female Seminary in 1881, Jane Addams founded, with Ellen Gates Starr, the world famous social settlement Hull-House on Chicago's Near West Side in 1889. From Hull-House, where she lived and worked until her death in 1935, Jane Addams built her reputation as the country's most prominent woman through her writing, settlement work, and international efforts for peace.\n\nSocial settlements began in the 1880s in London in response to problems created by urbanization, industrialization, and immigration. The idea spread to other industrialized countries. Settlement houses typically attracted educated, native born, middle-class and upper-middle class women and men, known as “residents,” to live (settle) in poor urban neighborhoods. Some social settlements were linked to religious institutions. Others, like Hull-House, were secular. By 1900, the U.S. had over 100 settlement houses. By 1911, Chicago had 35.\n\nIn the 1890s, Hull-House was located in the midst of a densely populated urban neighborhood peopled by Italian, Irish, German, Greek, Bohemian, and Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants. During the 1920s, African Americans and Mexicans began to put down roots in the neighborhood and joined the clubs and activities at Hull-House. Jane Addams and the Hull-House residents provided kindergarten and day care facilities for the children of working mothers; an employment bureau; an art gallery; libraries; English and citizenship classes; and theater, music and art classes. As the complex expanded to include thirteen buildings, Hull-House supported more clubs and activities such as a Labor Museum, the Jane Club for single working girls, meeting places for trade union groups, and a wide array of cultural events.\n\nThe residents of Hull-House formed an impressive group, including Jane Addams, Ellen Gates Starr, Florence Kelley, Dr. Alice Hamilton, Julia Lathrop, Sophonisba Breckinridge, and Grace and Edith Abbott. From their experiences in the Hull-House neighborhood, the Hull-House residents and their supporters forged a powerful reform movement. Among the projects that they helped launch were the Immigrants' Protective League, the Juvenile Protective Association, the first juvenile court in the nation, and a Juvenile Psychopathic Clinic (later called the Institute for Juvenile Research). Through their efforts, the Illinois Legislature enacted protective legislation for women and children in 1893. With the creation of the Federal Children's Bureau in 1912 and the passage of a federal child labor law in 1916, the Hull-House reformers saw their efforts expanded to the national level.\n\nJane Addams wrote prolifically on topics related to Hull-House activities, producing eleven books and numerous articles as well as maintaining an active speaking schedule nationwide and throughout the world. She played an important role in many local and national organizations. A founder of the Chicago Federation of Settlements in 1894, she also helped to establish the National Federation of Settlements and Neighborhood Centers in 1911. She was a leader in the Consumers League and served as the first woman president of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections (later the National Conference of Social Work). She was chair of the Labor Committee of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, vice-president of the Campfire Girls, and a member of the executive boards of the National Playground Association and the National Child Labor Committee. In addition, she actively supported the campaign for woman suffrage and the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (1909) and the American Civil Liberties Union (1920).\n\nIn the early years of the twentieth century Jane Addams became involved in the peace movement. During the First World War, she and other women from belligerent and neutral nations met at the International Congress of Women at the Hague in 1915, attempting to stop the war. She maintained her pacifist stance after the United States entered the war in 1917, working to found the Women's Peace Party (WILPF), which became the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in 1919. She was the WILPF's first president. As a result of her work, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.\n\nJane Addams died in Chicago on May 21, 1935.

Mrs. Elam and Isadore Anna Drell purchased the home at 4726 South Park Way in 1926, when demand outgrew space in the Champlain residence. Between the 1930s and the 1950s, Elam Home often housed over 30 women and girls at a time. The home was also the center of many Black, civic, social, and cultural events, including a state convention for African American women.\n\nMrs. Elam died in 1941 and her niece Loretta Peyton took over as trustee of the home.

  {category: "chicago", content: "The Democratic National Convention of 1864 was by most accounts a disaster. Meeting in Chicago to nominate General McClellan to oppose Lincoln,  the party struggled with an unhealed rift between delegats who wanted to crush the Confederacy in one big blow and those who wanted to quit fighting and just let the South go. The Tribune’s coverage made the convention look like a regular amateur hour.\n\nBut one man was more impressed: Wilbur F. Storey, arch-conservative editor of the Lincoln-hating Chicago Times. A year before, when he described Lincoln’s speech at Gettysburg as “silly, flat and dishwatery utterances,” he was being relatively subdued in his criticism. Months before, he had said that “history does not acquaint us with so deplorable a failure as this administration,” and held up the coming Emancipation Proclamation as proof of what he’d said all along: that Lincoln was coming to take people’s slaves. This was no war to preserve the union, he said, but a contest to free  “the debased and irredeemably barbarous negro.” (1) The proclamation itself, he said “Will be known in all history as the most wicked, atrocious and revolting deed recorded in the annals of civilization.”(2) (That the war was something to do with states’ rights would not become a conservative talking point for decades).\n\nEven this was not Storey at his worst. Though far more loquacious than most modern cable news loudmouths, some of his racial ramblings would fit in fine among alt-right commenters on youtube. In 1862 he complained that rather than caring about the rights of white men, congress had “n—r on the brain, n—r in the bowels, n—r in the eyes, n—r, n—r everywhere….all powers have found their superior in the great n—r power that moves the huge, unwieldy, reeking and stewing mess of rottenness which makes up this administration and its party.” (3) Though it’s common now for detractors to claim that Lincoln didn’t do enough for the slaves, or that he was really just as big of a racist as any slave-holder, Storey’s rants (and his paper’s popularity) can be useful in showing just what Lincoln was up against.\n\nNaturally, Storey supported McClellan in 1864, and covered the Democrat Convention as though it was the Second Coming (it’s useful to note that the parties of 1864 were very different; Storey referred to his party as both “The democrats” and “conservatives,” while referring to republicans as “the abolitionist party.”) Its in his election coverage that Storey’s rants and language seem most strikingly modern in 2016. Months before the convention, he’d suggested that Lincoln was going to rig the election and refuse to allow conservatives to vote. In an August 31, 1864 editorial, “Plots of Old Abe,” he doubled down on the claim. “The machinery for carrying out the… plot is in readiness,” he wrote. “It will certainly be applied unless, in the interim, the people of Illinois assume such an attitude as will convince the tyrant that there is one step that he cannot with safety take. Let it be understood that… any attempt on the part of the despot to do otherwise (than conduct a fair election) will surely lead to bloodshed, and, perhaps, even at the last moment, the attempt to coerce Illinois may be abandoned.", title: "“Rigged!” The Chicago Times and the Election of 1864"},

And they ignored crimes happening right in front of their eyes.\n\nThese were the findings of an investigation in 1904 called the Piper Report. Chicago's police department was given the most unmerciful raking in its history, the Tribune reported at the time.\nMore than a century before a recent U.S. Department of Justice report excoriated the Chicago Police Department for widespread failures, Chicago police faced scrutiny from an outside investigator.\n\nThe condition is 'rotten,' said Louis Grossman, a Chicago private eye who worked on the 1904 report. The police of Chicago are 'piano movers,' bums, cripples, janitors, ward heelers — anything but policemen. They have no respect for the law, and depend upon their pull with the alderman to get them out of trouble. Out of all the precincts we have watched, we have found but two patrolmen who did their duty. They sleep when they should be on their rounds. They play the slot machines and drink with any one who asks them.\n\nThe probe was led by retired Army Capt. Alexander Piper, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy who'd fought in battles against Sioux Indians and in the Spanish-American War. Piper, who'd lost his right arm to a gunshot, had also served as a New York City police official.\nIn early 1904, the City Club of Chicago hired him to snoop on Chicago's police. That civic group, known today for hosting political speeches, had just formed in December 1903. For months, newspapers had been filled with headlines about murders and holdups. Meanwhile, a committee of aldermen was investigating graft, hearing testimony about cops allegedly taking protection money from prostitutes and criminals. The police superintendent, Francis O'Neill, had a reputation for honesty, but he faced criticism for allowing corruption and inaction.\n\nChicago's cops weren't yet represented by a union, but in January 1904 they formed a protective association, raising money to defend officers facing misconduct accusations. Tribune editorials denounced the association's hostility to investigation, calling it a slush fund to hide corruption.\nPiper and two investigators spent six weeks visiting police stations, walking streets and watching cops. They saw 174 incidents they described as dereliction of duty, including on-duty officers drinking in taverns. William Maher, one of Piper's assistants, wrote in the report that he didn't see any cops pay for their drinks. They thought nothing of going off post to get a shave, taking off their hats and sitting down for an hour, or going into a concert saloon, seeing women solicit men for the purpose of prostitution in their presence, he said.\nOne police official explained to Piper why a cop should visit saloons: By going there he can become friendly with the saloonkeeper and obtain information about criminals that he could not get elsewhere.", title: "Chicago police were condemned in 1904 for drinking, slouching, ignoring crime"},
  {category: "chicago", content: "he Chicago Freedom Movement, led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and Al Raby, was created to challenge systematic racial segregation and discrimination in Chicago and its suburbs. The movement which included rallies, protest marches, boycotts, and other forms of non-violent direct action addressed a variety of issues facing black Chicago residents, including segregated housing, educational deficiencies, income, employment, and health disparities based on racism and black community development. The Chicago Freedom Movement, the most ambitious civil rights campaign in the northern United States, lasted from mid-1965 to early 1967 and is credited with inspiring the Fair Housing Act passed by the U.S. Congress in 1968.  \nThe Chicago Campaign began in July 1965 when local civil rights groups invited Dr. King to lead demonstrations against segregation in education and housing as well as employment discrimination. Chicago activist Albert Raby, leader of the Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), asked the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to join them in a nonviolent campaign to achieve fair or open housing in the city. Community organizers pointed to Chicago’s history as one of the most racially segregated cities in the nation. Through lending discrimination and, in some instances, outright violence and intimidation, African Americans were kept out of the vast majority of predominately or all-white middle class neighborhoods in the city. Activists hoped that by changing the laws and practices to allow “open housing,” the ability of black homeowners to purchase homes in any area they could financially afford, blacks would gain access to improved housing, better schools, and greater job opportunities.  \n\nOn January 7, 1966, King and the SCLC announced plans for a Chicago Freedom Movement, a campaign that marked the expansion of their civil rights activities from the South to northern cites. King and his family moved to a Chicago slum at the end of January to bring attention to housing conditions of tens of thousands of black Chicago residents while CCCO organized mass nonviolent protests in the city.\n\nTo target racial demonstration in housing and employment, SCLC launched Operation Breadbasket and placed it under the leadership of twenty-five-year-old SCLC organizer, Rev. Jessie Jackson. Operation Breadbasket targeted companies and corporations working in African American neighborhoods that nonetheless refused to hire black employees. The parallel campaigns gained momentum through boycotts, demonstrations, marches, and the race riots that erupted on Chicago’s predominately black West Side in July 1966. On August 5, 1966, during a march at Marquette Park, an all-white Chicago neighborhood, to promote open housing, black and white demonstrators were met with intense racially-fueled hostility. Bottles and bricks were thrown at them. Dr. King, leader of the march, was struck by a rock. King admitted in a post-march interview that he had seen many anti-civil rights demonstrations in the South but none that was as hostile and violent as the one he experienced in Marquette Park.\n\nKing faced the challenge of mobilizing Chicago’s diverse African American community of nearly one million people. He cautioned against further violence and worked to counter the mounting resistance of working class whites who were fearful of the impact of open housing on their neighborhoods. By August, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley sought a way to end the demonstrations. After negotiating with King and various housing boards, an agreement was announced on August 26, 1966, in which the Chicago Housing Authority promised to build public housing in predominately white areas, and the Mortgage Bankers Association agreed to make mortgages available, regardless of race or neighborhood. After the agreement was announced, some SCLC staff stayed behind to assist with the housing programs and voter registration. Dr. King stayed in Chicago until January 1967, while Jackson settled permanently in the city to lead the Chicago branch of Operation Breadbasket. In 1968 the U.S. Congress passed the 1968 Fair Housing Act, as the most direct result of the Chicago Freedom Movement.", title: "Chicago Freedom Movement"},

Winds blowing off the prairie fed the flames, and the fire spread rapidly, eventually consuming a four-mile-long and two-third-mile-wide swath of Chicago. When the Great Fire was finally over two days later, nearly 300 people were dead, one hundred thousand were homeless, and Chicago’s booming downtown was in ashes. Despite the devastation, Chicago would rise again and continue to be the economic center of the American West for decades to come.\n\nMost people think of Chicago as a midwestern city, and geographically it obviously is. But economically, Chicago is best seen as the unofficial regional capital and economic center of the American West. Because of its location on the western edge of a system of lakes, rivers, and canals that linked the city to the East, Chicago was the natural destination for both western raw materials moving East and eastern manufactured goods moving West. After the Civil War, Chicago quickly eclipsed St. Louis as the primary trading hub between East and West, and the city’s fate was inextricably tied to the rapidly growing settlement and development of western natural resources. Millions of dollars worth of cattle, lumber, swine, and grain that had originated in the plains of Wyoming or the mountains of Montana were channeled through the massive freight yards, slaughterhouses, and grain elevators of Chicago. Indeed, a look at a map of the U.S. during the 1880s revealed that while all roads may have once led to Rome, by the late 19th century all railroads led to Chicago.\n\nAlthough the Great Fire of 1871 destroyed Chicago’s downtown, it left most of the city’s essential industrial infrastructure in place.

  {category: "chicago", content: "Paul M. Angle has certainly succeeded in producing a unique work; namely, a history of a historical society which is witty, readable, and, at the same time, informative and factually accurate. He has accomplished this result by a skillful selection of letters, documents, and news clippings which he allows to speak for themselves, with but brief introductions and comments. It is a work of stark impressionism, done with broad strokes and in vivid colors. In consequence, it communicates to the reader a sense of identification with events in the life of the Chicago Historical Society and of Chicago which no dry chronological record of the minutiae of society records could possibly accomplish. It stimulates the imagination of the reader to cooperate with the author to amplify his pungent comments. There is a laugh on nearly every page.\n\nOf course, no one could tell the tale of the Chicago Historical Society in the first century of its life (1856–1956) without reflecting the highlights of Chicago history in this fabulous era when Chicago was transformed from a crude trading village set in a wilderness to a mighty metropolis; the true capital of the Middle West; the financial center of the richest empire the world has even known; and a formidable cultural and educational venture.\n\nThe only astonishing phenomenon is that, considering the vast effort necessarily expended in this century by the citizens of Chicago in the material realm, they had energy left to cultivate the arts and foresight to document their history in the making by supporting so generously their historical society and accumulating the documents, letters, books, and records which perpetuate their experiences.\n\nIn the great Chicago fires of 1871 and 1874 the Society's building and all of its original collections were destroyed, including two thousand volumes of sermons with which the more pious early inhabitants seem to have endowed the library. But the Society arose from the ashes, and in the ensuing seventy-five years has accumulated a distinguished library and collection of invaluable historical source material contained in a beautiful building of noble proportions, in which likewise is housed a museum which displays & visual pageant of Chicago's history. The vigilance of the Society's officers is to be commended, particularly in their solicitation in 1882 of a gift of the Lincoln papers then in the custody of Robert Todd Lincoln, who, in his reply to the Society (August 27, 1882) made one of the most colossal understatements of all times when he said: In reply to your letter of August 7th respecting the custody of letters and documents received and preserved by my father and mother, I have to say to you that the idea of placing them in the custody of the Historical Society would strike me with favor if there were anything of sufficient consequence to include in such a collection. …\n\nWhile the Society acquired none of the Washington papers, we are relieved to learn that it has one of his razors. Amongst its more gruesome artifacts are the bones of John Lalime, one of the earliest settlers of Chicago. But the Society felt obliged to decline, in 1943, the preferred gift by Sally Rand of the fan which she used so effectively in her famous dances at the Chicago World's Fair of 1933. The Chicago Daily News headline of this event is duly recorded: Sally Rand pitches curves to fan Historical Society.\n\nAngle modestly described his work as an unconventional chronicle. And so it is. But it will be read with chuckles by succeeding generations, which is more than can be said of the mine run of society histories.\n\nThe book is a most attractive example of printing and binding, and contains a serviceable index.", title: "The Chicago Historical Society"},

At a time when only whites were allowed to play on professional basketball teams, Saperstein decided to promote his new team’s racial makeup by naming them after Harlem, the famous African-American neighborhood of New York City. The son of a tailor, Saperstein sewed their red, white and blue uniforms (emblazoned with the words “New York”) himself. The lineup in that first game, for which the Globetrotters were paid $75, was Walter “Toots” Wright, Byron “Fat” Long, Willis “Kid” Oliver, Andy Washington and Al “Runt” Pullins.\n\nThe Globetrotters won 101 out of 117 games that first season and introduced many Midwestern audiences to a game they had not seen played before. As owner, coach, manager, publicist and sometimes even substitute player, Saperstein worked overtime to book games for his team. By 1936, they had played more than 1,000 games and appeared in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Michigan, Montana, Washington and North and South Dakota. (The Globetrotters didn’t actually play a game in Harlem until the late 1960s.) Their first national championship appearance came in 1939, when the Globetrotters lost to the New York Renaissance. That same year, the team began to add the silly antics they later became known for, including ball handling tricks and on-court comedic routines. The crowds loved it, and Saperstein told his team to keep up the clowning around, but only when they had achieved a solid lead.\n\nIn 1948, the Globetrotters earned a new measure of respect by beating the Minneapolis Lakers of the newly established National Basketball Association (NBA). Two years later, the NBA lifted its “whites only” ban and began to draft black players, forcing Saperstein to compete for his talent. By this time, the Globetrotters were actively touring on the international circuit, playing to audiences in post-war Berlin, Eastern Europe and Russia, among other places; they even performed once for Pope Pius XII in Rome. Some of the Globetrotters who went on to become NBA stars include Wilt Chamberlain, Connie Hawkins and Nat Clifton.\n\nAfter Saperstein’s death in 1966, the team was sold to a group of Chicago businessmen for $3.7 million; they later sold it to Metro Media for $11 million. Reaching the height of their fame in the 1970s, the Globetrotters began to lose fans during the next decade, after the departure of such longtime stars as Meadowlark Lemmon. In 1985, Olympic gold medalist Lynette Woodard became the first female Globetrotter.\n\nOver the years, the Harlem Globetrotters have played in more than 115 countries in front of 120 million fans. They have been the subject of two feature films and numerous television shows, including two animated series in the 1970s. In honor of their entertainment value, the team was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and made the subject of a permanent exhibit at the Smithsonian Institute. Their pioneering history and considerable athletic skill over the years was honored in 2002, when they were inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n  by Taboola Promoted Links \n", title: "Harlem Globetrotters play their first game"},
  {category: "chicago", content: "A fire in the Iroquois Theater in Chicago, Illinois, kills more than 600 people on this day in 1903. It was the deadliest theater fire in U.S. history. Blocked fire exits and the lack of a fire-safety plan caused most of the deaths.\n\nThe Iroquois Theater, designed by Benjamin Marshall in a Renaissance style, was highly luxurious and had been deemed fireproof upon its opening in 1903. In fact, George Williams, Chicago’s building commissioner, and fire inspector Ed Laughlin looked over the theater in November 1903 and declared that it was “fireproof beyond all doubt.” They also noted its 30 exits, 27 of which were double doors. However, at the same time, William Clendenin, the editor of Fireproof magazine, also inspected the Iroquois and wrote a scathing editorial about its fire dangers, pointing out that there was a great deal of wood trim, no fire alarm and no sprinkler system over the stage.\n\nDuring the matinee performance of December 30, while a full house was watching Eddie Foy star in Mr. Bluebeard, 27 of the theater’s 30 exits were locked. In addition, stage manager Bill Carlton went out front to watch the show with the 2,000 patrons while the other stage hands left the theater and went out for a drink. It was a spotlight operator who first noticed that one of the calcium lights seemed to have sparked a fire backstage. The cluttered area was full of fire fuel–wooden stage props and oily rags.\n\nWhen the actors became aware of the fire, they scattered backstage; Foy later returned and tried to calm the audience, telling them to stay seated. An asbestos curtain was to be lowered that would confine the fire but when it wouldn’t come fully down, a panic began. It later turned out to be made of paper so it wouldn’t have helped in any case. Soon, all the lights inside the theater went out and there were stampedes near the open exits. When the back door was opened, the shift of air caused a fireball to roar through the backstage area.\n\nThe teenage ushers working the theater fled immediately, forgetting to open the locked emergency exit doors. The few doors that were able to be forced open were four feet above the sidewalk, which slowed down the exiting process. Most of the 591 people who died were seated in the balconies. There were no fire escapes or ladders to assist them and some took their chances and jumped. The bodies were piled six deep near the narrow balcony exits. In fact, some people were knocked down by the falling bodies and were eventually pulled out alive from under burned victims.\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, Williams was later charged and convicted of misfeasance. Chicago’s mayor was also indicted, though the charges didn’t stick. The theater owner was convicted of manslaughter due to the poor safety provisions; the conviction was later appealed and reversed. In fact, the only person to serve any jail time in relation to this disaster was a nearby saloon owner who had robbed the dead bodies while his establishment served as a makeshift morgue following the fire.", title: "Fire breaks out in Chicago theater"},

The cruiser was equipped with a machine shop and could carry enough coal to steam for 18 days, but its sails could greatly extend that time. Under its captain, Raphael Semmes, the Alabama prowled the world for three years, capturing U.S. commercial ships. It sailed around the globe, usually working out of the West Indies, but taking prizes and bungling Union shipping in the Caribbean, off Newfoundland, and around the coast of South America. In January 1863, Semmes sunk a Union warship, the Hatteras, after luring it out of Galveston, Texas. The Union navy spent an enormous amount of time and effort trying to track down the Alabama.\n\nThe ship sailed around South America, across the Pacific, and docked in India in 1864. By the summer, Semmes realized that after three years and 75,000 miles his vessel needed overhauling in a modern shipyard. He sailed around Africa to France, where the French denied him access to a dry dock. Semmes moved out of Cherbourg Harbor and found the USS Kearsarge waiting. In a spectacular battle, the Kearsarge bested and sank the Alabama. During its career, the Alabama captured 66 ships and was hunted by more than 20 Federal warships.", title: "USS Kearsarge sinks CSS Alabama"},

He was driving a four-wheel vehicle, dubbed the “999,” with a wooden chassis but no body or hood. Ford’s record was broken within a month at Ormond Beach, Florida, by a driver named William K. Vanderbilt; even so, the publicity surrounding Ford’s achievement was valuable to the auto pioneer, who in June of the previous year had incorporated the Ford Motor Company, which would eventually go on to become one of America’s Big Three automakers.\n\nHenry Ford was born on a farm in present-day Dearborn, Michigan, on July 30, 1863. In 1896, Ford, then an engineer in Detroit, built a four-wheel, self-propelled vehicle with a gasoline engine that he called the Quadricycle. Three years later, he founded the Detroit Automobile Company; however, by early 1901 the business failed. That same year, Henry Ford became involved in auto racing as a means to promote himself and gather investors for future automaking ventures. Late that year, the Henry Ford Company was established. The following year, Ford left the business after clashing with Henry Leland, who had been hired as a consultant. (Leland subsequently gave Ford’s company a new name: the Cadillac Automobile Company.)\n\nOn June 16, 1903, Ford incorporated a new company: the Ford Motor Company. In January of the following year, Ford set his record at Lake St. Clair, racing 1 mile in 39.4 seconds for a record speed of 91.37 mph. For the next several years, Ford continued to build race cars that met with varying degrees of success. In 1908, Ford launched a car for the masses, the Model T, which revolutionized the automotive industry–and American society in general–by providing affordable, reliable transportation for the average person. To promote the Model T, Ford entered it in races. In 1909, the Model T won a New York-to-Seattle race and although it was later disqualified due to a technicality, the event provided great advertising for Ford. Over the next few years, the Model T won a variety of races around the U.S. In 1913, Ford, who was reportedly unhappy with certain rules of auto racing, quit the sport. (Now that his company was a success, he didn’t require the publicity from racing anyway.)\n\nIn 1913, Ford Motor Company began employing the moving assembly line at its plant in Highland Park, Michigan, which reduced the assembly speed of a chassis from 12 hours and eight minutes to one hour and 33 minutes. The following year, Ford produced over 308,000 vehicles, more than the output of all other carmakers combined. The Model T, which was in production until 1927, became the world’s top-selling vehicle until the Volkswagen Beetle surpassed it in 1972.

  {category: "world", content: "On this day in 1965, Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax pitches the eighth perfect game in major league history, leading the Dodgers to a 1-0 win over the Chicago Cubs at Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles.\n\nSandy Koufax was a talented all-around athlete from Borough Park in Brooklyn, New York. His first love was basketball, and he attended the University of Cincinnati on a basketball scholarship. His impressive left arm, however, attracted the attention of major league ball clubs and in 1954 he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers. Despite his promising talent, Koufax won just 36 games to 51 losses from 1955 to 1961, and was incredibly inconsistent, blowing hitters away one game and walking in runs the next. Finally, advice from veteran catcher Norm Sherry turned Koufax around. As Koufax recounted in his autobiography, Sherry told him to “take the grunt out of the fastball.” It worked: From 1962 to 1966, Sandy Koufax executed what are arguably the five greatest seasons by a pitcher in baseball history. His newfound control limited his walks from 4.8 per game to just 2.1, and he pitched no-hitters in three consecutive years–1962, 1963 and 1964.\n\nOn September 9, 1965, at the peak of his baseball career, Koufax took the mound against fellow lefty Bob Hendley of the Chicago Cubs, and a pitcher’s duel for the ages ensued. The Cubs were held scoreless, while the Dodgers scored just one run, in the fifth inning. Dodger Lou Johnson walked to lead off the inning, and then advanced to second on a sacrifice. He stole third and then scored when the Cubs catcher fumbled one of Hendley’s throws. As it turned out, one run was all Koufax needed to bring home the victory. His fastballs, which seemed to rise as they reached the plate, whizzed past batters. His curveball was typically devastating, buckling batters at the knees, almost always crossing the plate as a strike after following its parabolic path. As he closed in on a perfect game, Koufax faced the middle of the Cubs order. He struck out Ron Santo and Ernie Banks in the eighth before striking out the side in the ninth to secure his first perfect game.\n\nIn addition to throwing his first and only perfect game, Koufax struck out a total of 382 batters in 1965, shattering Rube Waddell’s 1904 record by 32. He retired after the 1966 season at just 30 years old because of arthritis in his elbow.\n\nKoufax won three Cy Young Awards (1963, 1965 and 1966), all of them unanimous.\n\nHe was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1972. In 2007, the Modi’in Miracle of the Israel Baseball League made the 71-year old Koufax the final pick in the league’s inaugural player draft as a tribute to his legendary career and Jewish heritage.", title: "Sandy Koufax pitches perfect game"},

For 30 years, the mighty Native American warrior had battled to protect his tribe’s homeland; however, by 1886 the Apaches were exhausted and hopelessly outnumbered. General Nelson Miles accepted Geronimo’s surrender, making him the last Indian warrior to formally give in to U.S. forces and signaling the end of the Indian Wars in the Southwest.\n\nGeronimo was born in 1829 and grew up in what is present-day Arizona and Mexico. His tribe, the Chiricahua Apaches, clashed with non-Indian settlers trying to take their land. In 1858, Geronimo’s family was murdered by Mexicans. Seeking revenge, he later led raids against Mexican and American settlers. In 1874, the U.S. government moved Geronimo and his people from their land to a reservation in east-central Arizona. Conditions on the reservation were restrictive and harsh and Geronimo and some of his followers escaped. Over the next decade, they battled federal troops and launched raids on white settlements. During this time, Geronimo and his supporters were forced back onto the reservation several times. In May 1885, Geronimo and approximately 150 followers fled one last time. They were pursued into Mexico by 5,000 U.S. troops. In March 1886, General George Crook (1829–90) forced Geronimo to surrender; however, Geronimo quickly escaped and continued his raids. General Nelson Miles (1839–1925) then took over the pursuit of Geronimo, eventually forcing him to surrender that September near Fort Bowie along the Arizona-New Mexico border. Geronimo and a band of Apaches were sent to Florida and then Alabama, eventually ending up at the Comanche and Kiowa reservation near Fort Sill, Oklahoma Territory. There, Geronimo became a successful farmer and converted to Christianity. He participated in President Theodore Roosevelt’s inaugural parade in 1905.

John Charles Fremont of California, the famous explorer of the West, was nominated for the presidency, and William Dewis Dayton of New Jersey was chosen as the candidate for the vice presidency.\n\nIn 1854, Congress moved to vote on the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, an act that would dissolve the terms of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and allow slave or free status to be decided in the territories by popular sovereignty. When it seemed the bill would win congressional passage, the Whig Party, which could not adequately cope with the issue of slavery, disintegrated. By February 1854, anti-slavery factions of the former Whig Party had begun meeting in the upper Midwestern states to discuss the formation of a new party. One such meeting, at Ripon, Wisconsin, on March 20, 1954, is generally remembered as the founding meeting of the Republican Party.\n\nThe Republicans, who called for the abolition of slavery in all U.S. territories, rapidly gained supporters in the North, and in 1856 their first presidential candidate, John Fremont, won 11 of the 16 Northern states. By 1860, the majority of Southern states were publicly threatening secession if a Republican won the presidency. On November 6, 1860, Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected president over a divided Democratic Party, and six weeks later South Carolina formally seceded from the Union. Within six more weeks, five other Southern states had followed South Carolina’s lead. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began when Confederate shore batteries under General P.G.T. Beauregard opened fire on Fort Sumter in South Carolina’s Charleston Bay.\n\nThe Civil War firmly identified the Republican Party as the official party of the victorious North. After the war, the Republican-dominated Congress forced a radical Reconstruction policy on the South, which saw the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, abolishing slavery and granting voting rights to African American men in the South.

  {category: "world", content: "American pilot Charles A. Lindbergh lands at Le Bourget Field in Paris, successfully completing the first solo, nonstop transatlantic flight and the first ever nonstop flight between New York to Paris. His single-engine monoplane, The Spirit of St. Louis, had lifted off from Roosevelt Field in New York 33 1/2 hours before.\n\nCharles Augustus Lindbergh, born in Detroit in 1902, took up flying at the age of 20. In 1923, he bought a surplus World War I Curtiss “Jenny” biplane and toured the country as a barnstorming stunt flyer. In 1924, he enrolled in the Army Air Service flying school in Texas and graduated at the top of his class as a first lieutenant. He became an airmail pilot in 1926 and pioneered the route between St. Louis and Chicago. Among U.S. aviators, he was highly regarded.\n\nIn May 1919, the first transatlantic flight was made by a U.S. hydroplane that flew from New York to Plymouth, England, via Newfoundland, the Azores Islands, and Lisbon. Later that month, Frenchman Raymond Orteig, an owner of hotels in New York, put up a purse of $25,000 to the first aviator or aviators to fly nonstop from Paris to New York or New York to Paris. In June 1919, the British fliers John W. Alcock and Arthur W. Brown made the first nonstop transatlantic flight, flying 1,960 miles from Newfoundland to Ireland. The flight from New York to Paris would be nearly twice that distance.\n\nOrteig said his challenge would be good for five years. In 1926, with no one having attempted the flight, Orteig made the offer again. By this time, aircraft technology had advanced to a point where a few thought such a flight might be possible. Several of the world’s top aviators–including American polar explorer Richard Byrd, French flying ace Rene Fonck–decided to accept the challenge, and so did Charles Lindbergh.\n\nLindbergh convinced the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce to sponsor the flight, and a budget of $15,000 was set. The Ryan Airlines Corporation of San Diego volunteered to build a single-engine aircraft to his specifications. Extra fuel tanks were added, and the wing span was increased to 46 feet to accommodate the additional weight. The main fuel tank was placed in front of the cockpit because it would be safest there in the event of a crash. This meant Lindbergh would have no forward vision, so a periscope was added. To reduce weight, everything that was not utterly essential was left out. There would be no radio, gas gauge, night-flying lights, navigation equipment, or parachute. Lindbergh would sit in a light seat made of wicker. Unlike other aviators attempting the flight, Lindbergh would be alone, with no navigator or co-pilot.\n\nThe aircraft was christened The Spirit of St. Louis, and on May 12, 1927, Lindbergh flew it from San Diego to New York, setting a new record for the fastest transcontinental flight. Bad weather delayed Lindbergh’s transatlantic attempt for a week. On the night of May 19, nerves and a newspaperman’s noisy poker game kept him up all night. Early the next morning, though he hadn’t slept, the skies were clear and he rushed to Roosevelt Field on Long Island. Six men had died attempting the long and dangerous flight he was about to take.\n\nAt 7:52 a.m. EST on May 20, The Spirit of St. Louis lifted off from Roosevelt Field, so loaded with fuel that it barely cleared the telephone wires at the end of the runway. Lindbergh traveled northeast up the coast. After only four hours, he felt tired and flew within 10 feet of the water to keep his mind clear. As night fell, the aircraft left the coast of Newfoundland and set off across the Atlantic. At about 2 a.m. on May 21, Lindbergh passed the halfway mark, and an hour later dawn came. Soon after, The Spirit of St. Louis entered a fog, and Lindbergh struggled to stay awake, holding his eyelids open with his fingers and hallucinating that ghosts were passing through the cockpit.\n\nAfter 24 hours in the air, he felt a little more awake and spotted fishing boats in the water. At about 11 a.m. (3 p.m. local time), he saw the coast of Ireland. Despite using only rudimentary navigation, he was two hours ahead of schedule and only three miles off course. He flew past England and by 3 p.m. EST was flying over France. It was 8 p.m. in France, and night was falling.\n\nAt the Le Bourget Aerodrome in Paris, tens of thousands of Saturday night revelers had gathered to await Lindbergh’s arrival. At 10:24 a.m. local time, his gray and white monoplane slipped out of the darkness and made a perfect landing in the air field. The crowd surged on The Spirit of St. Louis, and Lindbergh, weary from his 33 1/2-hour, 3,600-mile journey, was cheered and lifted above their heads. He hadn’t slept for 55 hours. Two French aviators saved Lindbergh from the boisterous crowd, whisking him away in an automobile. He was an immediate international celebrity.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge dispatched a warship to take the hero home, and “Lucky Lindy” was given a ticker-tape parade in New York and presented with the Congressional Medal of Honor. His place in history, however, was not complete.\n\nIn 1932, he was the subject of international headlines again when his infant son, Charles Jr., was kidnapped, unsuccessfully ransomed, and then found murdered in the woods near the Lindbergh home. German-born Bruno Richard Hauptmann was convicted of the crime in a controversial trial and then executed. Then, in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Lindbergh became a spokesperson for the U.S. isolationism movement and was sharply criticized for his apparent Nazi sympathies and anti-Semitic views. After the outbreak of World War II, the fallen hero traveled to the Pacific as a military observer and eventually flew more than two dozen combat missions, including one in which he downed a Japanese aircraft. Lindbergh’s war-time service largely restored public faith in him, and for many years later he worked with the U.S. government on aviation issues. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve. He died in Hawaii in 1974.\n\n", title: "Lindbergh lands in Paris"},
  {category: "world", content: "Near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orville and Wilbur Wright make the first successful flight in history of a self-propelled, heavier-than-air aircraft. Orville piloted the gasoline-powered, propeller-driven biplane, which stayed aloft for 12 seconds and covered 120 feet on its inaugural flight.\n\nOrville and Wilbur Wright grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and developed an interest in aviation after learning of the glider flights of the German engineer Otto Lilienthal in the 1890s. Unlike their older brothers, Orville and Wilbur did not attend college, but they possessed extraordinary technical ability and a sophisticated approach to solving problems in mechanical design. They built printing presses and in 1892 opened a bicycle sales and repair shop. Soon, they were building their own bicycles, and this experience, combined with profits from their various businesses, allowed them to pursue actively their dream of building the world’s first airplane.\n\nAfter exhaustively researching other engineers’ efforts to build a heavier-than-air, controlled aircraft, the Wright brothers wrote the U.S. Weather Bureau inquiring about a suitable place to conduct glider tests. They settled on Kitty Hawk, an isolated village on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, which offered steady winds and sand dunes from which to glide and land softly. Their first glider, tested in 1900, performed poorly, but a new design, tested in 1901, was more successful. Later that year, they built a wind tunnel where they tested nearly 200 wings and airframes of different shapes and designs. The brothers’ systematic experimentations paid off–they flew hundreds of successful flights in their 1902 glider at Kill Devils Hills near Kitty Hawk. Their biplane glider featured a steering system, based on a movable rudder, that solved the problem of controlled flight. They were now ready for powered flight.\n\nIn Dayton, they designed a 12-horsepower internal combustion engine with the assistance of machinist Charles Taylor and built a new aircraft to house it. They transported their aircraft in pieces to Kitty Hawk in the autumn of 1903, assembled it, made a few further tests, and on December 14 Orville made the first attempt at powered flight. The engine stalled during take-off and the plane was damaged, and they spent three days repairing it. Then at 10:35 a.m. on December 17, in front of five witnesses, the aircraft ran down a monorail track and into the air, staying aloft for 12 seconds and flying 120 feet. The modern aviation age was born. Three more tests were made that day, with Wilbur and Orville alternately flying the airplane. Wilbur flew the last flight, covering 852 feet in 59 seconds.\n\nDuring the next few years, the Wright brothers further developed their airplanes but kept a low profile about their successes in order to secure patents and contracts for their flying machines. By 1905, their aircraft could perform complex maneuvers and remain aloft for up to 39 minutes at a time. In 1908, they traveled to France and made their first public flights, arousing widespread public excitement. In 1909, the U.S. Army’s Signal Corps purchased a specially constructed plane, and the brothers founded the Wright Company to build and market their aircraft. Wilbur Wright died of typhoid fever in 1912; Orville lived until 1948.\n\nThe historic Wright brothers’ aircraft of 1903 is on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.", title: "First airplane flies"},

The exposition introduced Americans to all kinds of technological wonders—for instance, an alternating-current power plant, a 46-foot-long cannon, a 1,500-pound Venus de Milo made of chocolate, and Juicy Fruit gum—along with replicas of exotic places and carnival-style rides and games.\n\nFour years earlier, the Universal Exposition in Paris had featured an elaborate display of steam- and gas-powered vehicles, including the Serpollet-Peugeot steam tricar, named for its three wheels and powered by a coke-burning boiler and a lightweight, petrol-fueled four-wheeled car built by the German engineer Gottlieb Daimler. The Chicago fair promised an even more impressive spectacle. Its Transportation Building, designed by Louis Sullivan, was crammed full: Pack mules and horse-drawn carts crowded next to bicycles and boats. Most exciting of all were the rows of massive American-built steam locomotives that towered over everything else in the hall. Trains, the Exposition’s organizers seemed to say, were the transportation of the future.\n\nOnly one internal-combustion vehicle was on display at the fair, tucked away in the corner of the Transportation Building: another of the wire-wheeled, tiller-steered, one-cylinder platform quadricycles that Daimler had introduced to Parisian fairgoers in 1889. It was like nothing most Americans had ever seen and yet almost no one paid any attention to it. Reporters barely mentioned the Daimler car and it didn’t even appear in the exhibition catalog.\n\nBut a few very important people did notice it and studied it closely. One was the bicycle mechanic Charles Duryea, who used the Daimler car as the inspiration for the four-wheeled, one-cylinder Motor Wagon that he built with his brother Frank. In 1896, the Duryea Motor Wagon Company became the first company to mass-produce gas-powered vehicles in the United States.\n\nAnother admirer of the Daimler car was Henry Ford, who returned to Dearborn after the fair and built an internal-combustion quadricycle of his own. (He called it his “gasoline buggy.”) Ford drove his little car for the first time on July 4, 1896 and sold it later that year for $200. Just a few years later, he incorporated the Ford Motor Company and the automobile age had begun.", title: "The World’s Columbian Exposition closes in Chicago"},
  {category: "chicago", content: "Richard Warren Sears was born in Stewartville, Minnesota in 1863 to a wealthy family, which moved to nearby Spring Valley. In 1879, Sears' father died shortly after losing the family fortune in a speculative stock deal. Sears moved across the state to work as a railroad station agent in North Redwood, as well as in Minneapolis. While in North Redwood, a jeweler received an impressive shipment of watches which were unwanted. Sears purchased them, then sold the watches at a low price to the station agents and made a considerable profit.\n\nIn Minneapolis, he started a mail order watch business in 1886, calling it 'R.W. Sears Watch Company.' Within the first year he met Alvah C Roebuck, a watch repairman. The next year, they relocated the business to Chicago. In 1887, R.W. Sears Watch Company published Richard Sears' first mail-order catalog – in this case, offering watches, diamonds, and jewelry. In 1889, Sears sold his business for $100,000 ($2.7 million today) and relocated to Iowa, intending to be a rural banker.\n\nRestless, Sears returned to Chicago in 1892 and established a new mail-order firm, again selling watches and jewelry, with Roebuck as his partner, operating as the A. C. Roebuck watch company. In 1893, they renamed the company to Sears, Roebuck & Company and began to diversify the product lines offered in their catalogs. Before the Sears catalog, farmers near small rural towns usually purchased supplies – often at high prices and on credit – from local general stores with narrow selections of goods. Prices were negotiated, and relied on the storekeeper's estimate of a customer's creditworthiness. Sears took advantage of this by publishing catalogs offering customers a wider selection of products at clearly stated prices. By 1894, the Sears catalog had grown to 322 pages, featuring sewing machines, bicycles, sporting goods, automobiles (later produced, from 1905 to 1915, by Lincoln Motor Car Works of Chicago, no relation to the current Ford line), and a host of other new items. By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalog. Sales were greater than $400,000 ($10.9 million today) in 1893 and more than $750,000 ($22.1 million today) two years later. By 1896, dolls, stoves and groceries had been added to the catalog. Despite the strong and growing sales, the national Panic of 1893 led to a full scale recession, causing a cash squeeze and large quantities of unsold merchandise by 1895. Roebuck decided to quit, returning later in a publicity role. Sears offered Roebuck's half of the company to Chicago businessman Aaron Nusbaum, who in turn brought in his brother-in-law Julius Rosenwald, to whom Sears owed money. In August 1895, they bought Roebuck's half of the company for $75,000 ($2.2 million today). The company was reincorporated in Illinois with a capital stock of $150,000 ($4.4 million today) in August 1895. The 1895 transaction was handled by Albert Henry Loeb of the Chicago Law Firm of Loeb & Adler (now known as Arnstein & Lehr, LLP). Copies of the transaction documents are now displayed on the walls of the law firm.\n\nSears and Rosenwald got along well with each other, but not with Nusbaum. The pair bought Nusbaum out for $1.3 million in 1903 ($35.4 million today). Rosenwald brought to the mail order firm a rational management philosophy and diversified product lines: dry goods, consumer durables, drugs, hardware, furniture, and nearly anything else a farm household could desire. Sales continued to grow rapidly, and the prosperity of the company and their vision for greater expansion led Sears and Rosenwald to take the company public in 1906, with a stock placement of $40 million ($1.1 billion today). However, they had to incorporate a new company in order to bring the operation public. Sears and Rosenwald established Sears, Roebuck and Company (legal name Sears, Roebuck and Co.) in the state of New York and effectively replaced the original company. The current company inherits the history of the old company, celebrating the original 1892 incorporation, rather than the 1906 revision, as the start of the company.\n\nSears' successful 1906 initial public offering (IPO) marks the first major retail IPO in American financial history and represented a coming of age, financially, of the consumer sector.\n\nIn 1906, Sears opened its catalog plant and the Sears Merchandise Building Tower in Chicago's West Side. The building was the anchor of what would become the massive 40-acre Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex of offices, laboratories and mail-order operations at Homan Avenue and Arthington Street. The complex served as corporate headquarters until 1973, when the Sears Tower was completed, and served as the base of the mail order catalog business until 1993.\n\nBy 1907, under Rosenwald's leadership as Vice President and Treasurer, annual sales of the company climbed to roughly $50 million ($1.3 billion today). Sears resigned the presidency in 1908 due to declining health, with Rosenwald named president and chairman of the board and taking on full control.\n\nThe company was badly hurt during 1919–21 as a severe depression hit the nation's farms after farmers had overexpanded their holdings. To bail out the company, Rosenwald pledged $21 million in 1921 ($0.3 billion today) of his personal wealth.\n\nBy 1922, Sears had regained financial stability. Rosenwald oversaw the design and construction of the firm's first department store, built on land within the Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman until his death in 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.\n\nIn 1933, Sears issued the first of its famous Christmas catalogs known as the 'Sears Wishbook', a catalog featuring toys and gifts, separate from the annual Christmas Catalog. From 1908 to 1940, the catalog even included ready-to-assemble kit houses.\n\nBy that time, the Sears catalog had long been known in the industry as the Consumers Bible.Novelists and story writers often portrayed the importance of the catalog in the emotional lives of rural folk. The catalog also entered the language, particularly of rural dwellers, as a euphemism for toilet paper, as its pages could be torn out and used as such. For children and their parents, the catalog was eagerly flipped through, not always a question of purchasing but of dreaming; they made up stories about the lives of the models on the pages. The catalog was a means of entertainment, though much of its magic wore off with the passing of childhood.", title: "Sears incorporated"},
  {category: "chicago", content: "Jack Dempsey, the “Manassa Mauler,” misses an opportunity to regain the heavyweight boxing title when he fails to return to a neutral corner after knocking down champ Gene Tunney in a title match in Chicago. Dempsey waited five precious seconds before heading to the neutral corner, at which point the referee began the 10-count as the rules dictated. As the referee reached nine seconds, Tunney got back up to his feet. He had actually been down for what amounted to 14 seconds. Tunney went on to win the bout in a decision after 10 rounds.\n\nJack Dempsey, one of the most formidable and popular boxers of all time, was born in Manassa, Colorado, in 1895. One of 11 children, he left home at age 16 and traveled around Colorado’s mining towns, earning a living boxing under the name of “Kid Blackie.” In 1916, he abandoned saloon-floor matches in favor of professional bouts and earned a reputation as a quick and lethal fighter who generally knocked out his opponents at some point in the first round.\n\nBy 1919, Dempsey earned a fight with heavyweight champion Jess Willard. They met at an outdoor arena in Toledo, Ohio, on July 4. The 37-year-old champ was no match for the young brawler, and Dempsey attacked fast and furiously, knocking the giant to the canvas seven times in the first round. At the end of the third round, Willard had a broken jaw, a closed eye, two broken ribs, and a partial loss of hearing. He chose not to come out of his corner for the fourth round, and Dempsey was proclaimed the heavyweight champion of the world.\n\nDempsey, nicknamed the Manassa Mauler, was one of the great sports stars of the 1920s. He successfully defended his title five times in four years to the refrain of record-breaking ticket sales. He employed a brutally aggressive style that has been appropriated by many champions since. Bobbing and weaving, he remained on the offensive almost continuously, swinging rights and lefts out of his crouching stance with amazing speed and power. After a memorable match against Luis Angel Firpo–the “Wild Bull of the Pampas”–in 1923, Dempsey’s promoter decided it was in the champ’s best interest to fight as infrequently as possible, thereby ensuring that excitement and profit would be high when he did. In 1924 and 1925, Dempsey was out of the ring.\n\nMeanwhile, Gene Tunney, a scholarly former U.S. Marine with a refined boxing style, was steadily accumulating victories. The “Fighting Marine” lost sometimes, which may be why Dempsey agreed to meet Tunney for his first match in three years. On September 23, 1926, at Sesquicentennial Stadium in Philadelphia, Tunney dethroned a rusty Dempsey before 120,000 fans. Tunney never knocked Dempsey down, but he systematically accumulated enough points to win the heavyweight title in a decision after 10 rounds.\n\nDempsey briefly considered retiring, but in July 1927 he returned to the ring to defeat Jack Sarkey, which earned him a rematch with Tunney. On September 22, 1927, the Manassa Mauler came to Soldier Field in Chicago to regain his title. More than 100,000 spectators turned up, and there was talk that gangster Al Capone had tried to fix the fight. To avoid any possible charges of a fix, the referee was replaced at the last minute. Dave Barry, the new referee, took the boxers aside just before the match began and reminded them of a new rule that required a fighter scoring a knockdown to retreat to a neutral corner. He could not begin his count, he warned them, until the fighter on his feet started backing off to a far corner.\n\nAs the match got underway, Tunney took charge of the fight, racking up points and keeping Dempsey at bay. In the seventh round, however, the old Dempsey returned, knocking Tunney against the ropes and then felling him with three strong punches. Tunney went down, and Dempsey took a step back to the nearest corner–not a neutral corner. Barry rushed over to Dempsey and yelled, “Go to a neutral corner, Jack!” but Dempsey just stood there, glassy-eyed. Finally, Barry grabbed him and shoved him on his way. Dempsey shuffled across the ring, finally remembering the new rule that had been twice told to him before the match. Barry then began the 10-count, and Tunney got up at nine.\n\nTunney’s total of 14 seconds on the ground allowed him precious time to recuperate from Dempsey’s assault. He ran from his opponent for the rest of the round and then came back to dominate the eighth, even knocking Dempsey down briefly. Tunney won another decision.\n\nDempsey continued to box in exhibition matches until 1940, but he was never a serious contender again. He became a successful restaurateur in New York City and remained a popular figure until his death in 1983. Gene Tunney retired in 1928 after successfully defending his title against Tom Heeney. He became a wealthy business executive and died in 1978 at the age of 81. His son, John V. Tunney, was a U.S. senator.", title: "Dempsey loses on long count"},
  {category: "world", content: "At Auburn Prison in New York, the first execution by electrocution in history is carried out against William Kemmler, who had been convicted of murdering his lover, Matilda Ziegler, with an axe.\n\nElectrocution as a humane means of execution was first suggested in 1881 by Dr. Albert Southwick, a dentist. Southwick had witnessed an elderly drunkard “painlessly” killed after touching the terminals of an electrical generator in Buffalo, New York. In the prevalent form of execution at the time–death by hanging–the condemned were known to hang by their broken necks for up to 30 minutes before succumbing to asphyxiation.\n\nIn 1889, New York’s Electrical Execution Law, the first of its kind in the world, went into effect, and Edwin R. Davis, the Auburn Prison electrician, was commissioned to design an electric chair. Closely resembling the modern device, Davis’ chair was fitted with two electrodes, which were composed of metal disks held together with rubber and covered with a damp sponge. The electrodes were to be applied to the criminal’s head and back.\n\nOn August 6, 1890, William Kemmler became the first person to be sent to the chair. After he was strapped in, a charge of approximately 700 volts was delivered for only 17 seconds before the current failed. Although witnesses reported smelling burnt clothing and charred flesh, Kemmler was far from dead, and a second shock was prepared. The second charge was 1,030 volts and applied for about two minutes, whereupon smoke was observed coming from the head of Kemmler, who was clearly deceased. An autopsy showed that the electrode attached to his back had burned through to the spine.\n\nDr. Southwick applauded Kemmler’s execution with the declaration, “We live in a higher civilization from this day on,” while American inventor George Westinghouse, an innovator of the use of electricity, remarked, “They would have done better with an axe.”", title: "First execution by electric chair"},

The brothers grew up on a succession of Oklahoma and Kansas homesteads during the post-Civil War period, when the region was awash in violence lingering from the war and notorious outlaw bands like the James-Younger Gang. Still, the majority of the Dalton boys became law-abiding citizens, and one of the older brothers, Frank, served as a deputy U.S. marshal.\n\nIronically, Frank’s position in law enforcement brought his younger brothers into lives of crime. When Oklahoma whiskey runners murdered Frank in 1887, Grat took Frank’s place as a deputy marshal and recruited Emmett and Bob as assistants. Disillusioned by the fate of their older law-abiding brother, the three Dalton boys showed little respect for the law and began rustling cattle and horses to supplement their income. The brothers soon began to use their official law enforcement powers for their own ends, and in 1888, they killed a man for pursuing Bob’s girlfriend.\n\nSuch gross abuses of authority did not escape attention for long. By 1890, all three men were discredited as lawmen, though they managed to escape imprisonment. Taking up with some of the same hardcore criminals they had previously sworn to bring to justice, the Daltons decided to expand their criminal operations. Bob and Grat headed to California, leaving Emmett behind in Oklahoma because they felt he was still too young for a life of serious crime. In California, they planned to link up with their brother Bill and become bank and train robbers.\n\nThe Dalton Gang’s first attempt at train robbery was a fiasco. On February 6, 1891, Bob, Grat, and Bill tried to rob a Southern Pacific train near Alila, California. While Bill kept any passengers from interfering by shooting over their heads, Bob and Grat forced the engineer to show them the location of the cash-carrying express car. When the engineer tried to slip away, one of the brothers shot him in the stomach. Finding the express car on their own, Bob and Grat demanded that the guard inside open the heavy door. The guard refused and began firing down on them from a small spy hole. Thwarted, the brothers finally gave up and rode away.\n\nThe Daltons would have done well to heed the ominous signs of that first failed robbery and seek safer pursuits. Instead, they returned to Oklahoma, reunited with young Emmett, and began robbing in earnest. A year later, the gang botched another robbery, boldly attempting to hit two Coffeyville, Kansas, banks at the same time. Townspeople caught them in the act and killed Bob, Grat, and two of their gang members. Emmett was seriously wounded and served 14 years in prison.\n\nOf all the criminal Dalton brothers, only Emmett lived into old age. Freed from prison in 1907, he married and settled in Los Angeles, where he built a successful career in real estate and contracting.", title: "Dalton Gang commits its first train robbery"},

He was the first of eight children, but only he and a sister survived infancy. Ruth’s father was a saloon keeper on Baltimore’s waterfront, and the young George, known as “Gig” (pronounced with soft g’s) to his family, was known as a troublemaker from an early age. At seven, his truancy from school led his parents to declare him incorrigible, and he was sent to an orphanage, St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys. Ruth lived there until he was 19 in 1914, when he was signed as a pitcher by the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nThat same summer, Ruth’s contract was sold by the Orioles to the Boston Red Sox. His new teammates called him “Babe,” short for baby, for his naiveté, but his talent was already maturing, and he was almost immediately recognized as the best pitcher on one of the great teams of the 1910s. He set a record between 1916 and 1918 with 29 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings in World Series play, including a 14-inning game in 1916 in which he pitched every inning, giving up only a run in the first.\n\nTo the great dismay of Boston fans, Ruth’s contract was sold by the Red Sox to the New York Yankees before the 1920 season by Red Sox owner Harry Frazee, so that Frazee could finance the musical No, No, Nanette. Ruth switched to the outfield with the Yankees, and hit more home runs than the entire Red Sox team in 10 of the next 12 seasons. “The Sultan of Swat” or “The Bambino,” as he was alternately known, was the greatest gate attraction in baseball through the 1920s until his retirement as a player in 1935.\n\nThe 1927 season featured a fearsome Yankees lineup of power hitters known as “Murderer’s Row” that included Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzerri and Bob Meusel. Ruth led the American League in home runs throughout the year, but did not appear to be within reach of his record 59 home runs, set in 1921, until he hit 16 in the month of September, tying his record on September 29. On September 30, in the last game of the season, Ruth came to the plate against lefty Tom Zachary of the Washington Senators in the eighth inning. With the count at 2-1, Ruth launched a Zachary pitch high into the right-field bleachers, and then took a slow stroll around the bases as the crowd celebrated by tearing paper into confetti and throwing hats into the air. Upon assuming his position in right-field for the ninth inning, those seated in the bleachers waved hankies at the famed slugger; Ruth responded with multiple military salutes.\n\nDuring Ruth’s career with the New York Yankees, the team won four World Series and seven American League pennants. After getting rid of Ruth, the Red Sox did not win a World Series until 2004, an 85-year drought known to Red Sox fans as “the Curse of the Bambino.”\n\nRuth died of throat cancer on August 16, 1948.

At least forty-one of these tied-house buildings are known to\nsurvive in the city. They were built by large Milwaukee-based brewers, most notably Schlitz,\nand by several local brewers such as the Atlas, Birk Brothers, Fortune Brothers, Gottfried,\nPeter Hand, Standard, and Stege companies.

Owner William Hulbert signed multiple star players, such as pitcher Albert Spalding and infielders Ross Barnes, Deacon White, and Adrian 'Cap' Anson, to join the team prior to the N.L.'s first season. The White Stockings played their home games at West Side Grounds and quickly established themselves as one of the new league's top teams. Spalding won forty-seven games and Barnes led the league in hitting at .429 as Chicago won the first ever National League pennant, which at the time was the game's top prize.\n\nAfter back-to-back pennants in 1880 and 1881, Hulbert died, and Spalding, who had retired to start Spalding sporting goods, assumed ownership of the club. The White Stockings, with Anson acting as player-manager, captured their third consecutive pennant in 1882, and Anson established himself as the game's first true superstar. In 1885 and '86, after winning N.L. pennants, the White Stockings met the champions of the short-lived American Association in that era's version of a World Series. Both seasons resulted in match ups with the St. Louis Brown Stockings, with the clubs tying in 1885 and with St. Louis winning in 1886. This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest rivalries in sports. In all, the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886. As a result, Chicago's club nickname transitioned, and by 1890 they had become known as the Chicago Colts, or sometimes Anson's Colts, referring to Cap's influence within the club. Anson was the first player in history credited with collecting 3,000 career hits. After a disappointing record of 59–73 and a ninth-place finish in 1897, Anson was released by the Cubs as both a player and manager.

The repressive measures that Spain took to suppress the guerrilla war, such as herding Cuba’s rural population into disease-ridden garrison towns, were graphically portrayed in U.S. newspapers and enflamed public opinion. In January 1898, violence in Havana led U.S. authorities to order the battleship USS Maine to the city’s port to protect American citizens. On February 15, a massive explosion of unknown origin sank the Maine in the Havana harbor, killing 260 of the 400 American crewmembers aboard. An official U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry ruled in March, without much evidence, that the ship was blown up by a mine but did not directly place the blame on Spain. Much of Congress and a majority of the American public expressed little doubt that Spain was responsible, and called for a declaration of war.\n\nIn April, the U.S. Congress prepared for war, adopting joint congressional resolutions demanding a Spanish withdrawal from Cuba and authorizing President William McKinley to use force. On April 23, President McKinley asked for 125,000 volunteers to fight against Spain. The next day, Spain issued a declaration of war. The United States declared war on April 25. On May 1, the U.S. Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey destroyed the Spanish Pacific fleet at Manila Bay in the first battle of the Spanish-American War. Dewey’s decisive victory cleared the way for the U.S. occupation of Manila in August and the eventual transfer of the Philippines from Spanish to American control.\n\nOn the other side of the world, a Spanish fleet docked in Cuba’s Santiago harbor in May after racing across the Atlantic from Spain. A superior U.S. naval force arrived soon after and blockaded the harbor entrance. In June, the U.S. Army Fifth Corps landed in Cuba with the aim of marching to Santiago and launching a coordinated land and sea assault on the Spanish stronghold. Included among the U.S. ground troops were the Theodore Roosevelt-led “Rough Riders,” a collection of Western cowboys and Eastern blue bloods officially known as the First U.S. Voluntary Cavalry. On July 1, the Americans won the Battle of San Juan Hill, and the next day they began a siege of Santiago. On July 3, the Spanish fleet was destroyed off Santiago by U.S. warships under Admiral William Sampson, and on July 17 the Spanish surrendered the city–and thus Cuba–to the Americans.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, Spanish forces likewise crumbled in the face of superior U.S. forces, and on August 12 an armistice was signed between Spain and the United States. On December 10, the Treaty of Paris officially ended the Spanish-American War. The once-proud Spanish empire was virtually dissolved, and the United States gained its first overseas empire. Puerto Rico and Guam were ceded to the United States, the Philippines were bought for $20 million, and Cuba became a U.S. protectorate.

Although both chiefs wanted nothing more than to be left alone to pursue their traditional ways, the growing tide of white settlers invading their lands inevitably led to violent confrontations. Increasingly, the Sioux and Cheyenne who did try to cooperate with the U.S. government discovered they were rewarded only with broken promises and marginal reservation lands. In 1875, after the U.S. Army blatantly ignored treaty provisions and invaded the sacred Black Hills, many formerly cooperative Sioux and Cheyenne abandoned their reservations to join Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse in Montana. They would not return without a fight.\n\nLate in 1875, the U.S. Army ordered all the “hostile” Indians in Montana to return to their reservations or risk being attacked. Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse ignored the order and sent messengers out to urge other Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapahoe Indians to unite with them to meet the white threat. By the late spring of 1876, more than 10,000 Indians had gathered in a massive camp along a river in southern Montana called the Little Big Horn. “We must stand together or they will kill us separately,” Sitting Bull told them. “These soldiers have come shooting; they want war. All right, we’ll give it to them.”\n\nMeanwhile, three columns of U.S. soldiers were converging on the Little Big Horn. On June 17, the first column under the command of General George Crook was badly bloodied by Sioux and Cheyenne warriors led by Crazy Horse. Stunned by the size and ferocity of the Indian attack, Crook was forced to withdraw. Knowing nothing of Crook’s defeat, the two remaining columns commanded by General Alfred Terry and General John Gibbon continued toward the Little Big Horn. On June 22, Terry ordered the 7th Cavalry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Custer to scout ahead for Indians.\n\nOn the morning of this day in 1876, Custer’s scouts told him that a gigantic Indian village lay nearby in the valley of the Little Big Horn River. Custer dismissed the scouts’ claim that the village was extraordinarily large-certainly many thousands of Indians-as exaggerated. Indeed, his main fear was that the Indians would scatter before he could attack. Rather than wait for reinforcements, Custer decided to move forward immediately and stage an unusual mid-day attack. As the 7th Cavalry entered the valley, Custer divided the regiment of about 600 men into four battalions, keeping a force of 215 under his own command.\n\nIn the vast Indian encampment (historians estimate there were as many as 11,000 Indians), word quickly spread of the approaching soldiers. Too old actually to engage in battle, Sitting Bull rallied his warriors while seeing to the protection of the women and children. The younger Crazy Horse prepared for battle and sped off with a large force of warriors to meet the invaders.\n\nAs Custer’s divided regiment advanced, the soldiers suddenly found they were under attack by a rapidly growing number of Indians. Gradually, it dawned on Custer that his scouts had not exaggerated the size of the Indian force after all. He immediately dispatched urgent orders in an attempt to regroup his regiment. The other battalions, however, were facing equally massive attacks and were unable to come to his aid. Soon, Custer and his 215 men found themselves cut off and under attack by as many as 3,000 armed braves. Within an hour, they were wiped out to the last man. The remaining battalions of the 7th Cavalry were also badly beaten, but they managed to fight a holding action until the Indians withdrew the following day.\n\nThe Battle of the Little Big Horn was the Indians’ greatest victory and the army’s worst defeat in the long and bloody Plains Indian War. The Indians were not allowed to revel in the victory for long, however. The massacre of Custer and his 7th Cavalry outraged many Americans and only confirmed the image of the bloodthirsty Indians in their minds, and the government became more determined to destroy or tame the hostile Indians. The army redoubled its efforts and drove home the war with a vengeful fury. Within five years, almost all of the Sioux and Cheyenne would be confined to reservations. Crazy Horse was killed in 1877 after leaving the reservation without permission. Sitting Bull was shot and killed three years later in 1890 by a Lakota policeman.", title: "Indians defeat Custer at Little Big Horn"},
  {category: "world", content: "After ruling for less than one year, Edward VIII becomes the first English monarch to voluntarily abdicate the throne. He chose to abdicate after the British government, public, and the Church of England condemned his decision to marry the American divorcée Wallis Warfield Simpson. On the evening of December 11, he gave a radio address in which he explained, “I have found it impossible to carry on the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge the duties of king, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love.” On December 12, his younger brother, the duke of York, was proclaimed King George VI.\n\nEdward, born in 1894, was the eldest son of King George V, who became the British sovereign in 1910. Still unmarried as he approached his 40th birthday, he socialized with the fashionable London society of the day. By 1934, he had fallen deeply in love with American socialite Wallis Warfield Simpson, who was married to Ernest Simpson, an English-American businessman who lived with Mrs. Simpson near London. Wallis, who was born in Pennsylvania, had previously married and divorced a U.S. Navy pilot. The royal family disapproved of Edward’s married mistress, but by 1936 the prince was intent on marrying Mrs. Simpson. Before he could discuss this intention with his father, George V died, in January 1936, and Edward was proclaimed king.\n\nThe new king proved popular with his subjects, and his coronation was scheduled for May 1937. His affair with Mrs. Simpson was reported in American and continental European newspapers, but due to a gentlemen’s agreement between the British press and the government, the affair was kept out of British newspapers. On October 27, 1936, Mrs. Simpson obtained a preliminary decree of divorce, presumably with the intent of marrying the king, which precipitated a major scandal. To the Church of England and most British politicians, an American woman twice divorced was unacceptable as a prospective British queen. Winston Churchill, then a Conservative backbencher, was the only notable politician to support Edward.\n\nDespite the seemingly united front against him, Edward could not be dissuaded. He proposed a morganatic marriage, in which Wallis would be granted no rights of rank or property, but on December 2, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin rejected the suggestion as impractical. The next day, the scandal broke on the front pages of British newspapers and was discussed openly in Parliament. With no resolution possible, the king renounced the throne on December 10. The next day, Parliament approved the abdication instrument, and Edward VIII’s reign came to an end. The new king, George VI, made his older brother the duke of Windsor. On June 3, 1937, the duke of Windsor and Wallis Warfield married at the Château de Cande in France’s Loire Valley.\n\nFor the next two years, the duke and duchess lived primarily in France but visited other European countries, including Germany, where the duke was honored by Nazi officials in October 1937 and met with Adolf Hitler. After the outbreak of World War II, the duke accepted a position as liaison officer with the French. In June 1940, France fell to the Nazis, and Edward and Wallis went to Spain. During this period, the Nazis concocted a scheme to kidnap Edward with the intention of returning him to the British throne as a puppet king. George VI, like his prime minister, Winston Churchill, was adamantly opposed to any peace with Nazi Germany. Unaware of the Nazi kidnapping plot but conscious of Edward’s pre-war Nazi sympathies, Churchill hastily offered Edward the governorship of the Bahamas in the West Indies. The duke and duchess set sail from Lisbon on August 1, 1940, narrowly escaping a Nazi SS team sent to seize them.\n\nIn 1945, the duke resigned his post, and the couple moved back to France. They lived mainly in Paris, and Edward made a few visits to England, such as to attend the funerals of King George VI in 1952 and his mother, Queen Mary, in 1953. It was not until 1967 that the duke and duchess were invited by the royal family to attend an official public ceremony, the unveiling of a plaque dedicated to Queen Mary. Edward died in Paris in 1972 but was buried at Frogmore, on the grounds of Windsor Castle. In 1986, Wallis died and was buried at his side.", title: "Edward VIII abdicates"}
