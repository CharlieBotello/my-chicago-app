The window openings were changed and an exterior cladding of brick and corrugated aluminum was added. It remains a local attraction, as well as a nationally recognized example of work by one of architecture's most unusual figures."},

Bates & Co. of Chicago, and New York-based George A. Schastey & Co. The three-story, 24,000 square-foot Nickerson House was reported to be the largest and most extravagant private residence in Chicago at the time of its completion.
